About 99% of the Algerian population are Muslims, specifically Sunni Muslims.\n[\n1\n]\nIt also has Christian and Jewish minorities who make up less than 1% of the population.\nIslam was introduced to Algeria with the\nMuslim conquest of the Maghreb\nin the 7th century. Under\nUmayyad rule\n,\nMusa ibn Nusayr\ncontinued the program of spreading\nIslam\nand the\nArabic language\nthrough missionary activity and chose seventeen religious scholars to convert the locals. Many people became Muslims at the hands of these scholars and the inhabitants of the Maghreb gradually converted to Islam.\n[\n2\n]\nCaliph\nUmar ibn Abd al-Aziz\nsent to the governor of Ifriqiya\nIsmail ibn Abdallah\nall scholars and men of culture, who were ordered to teach the religion of Islam.\n[\n2\n]\nThey were distributed around the regions of the Maghreb. In less than one century, the great majority of Christians converted to Islam with 'great zeal that they sought martyrdom', and the final conversions took place in the first two centuries after the\nhijrah\n.\n[\n2\n]\nThe\nArab migration to the Maghreb\nconsolidated this process.\nSince independence after the\nAlgerian War\n, regimes have sought to develop an Islamic\nArab socialist\nstate, and a cabinet-level ministry acts for the government in religious affairs. President\nHouari Boum\u00e9diene\nsought to increase Islamic awareness and to reduce Western influence, although the rights of non-Muslims continued to be respected.\n[\n3\n]\nGreetings\n[\nedit\n]\nGreetings in Algeria have been described as lengthy. In addition to handshaking, Algerians ask about health, family and work to show concerns for others. Friends and family also exchange kisses on the cheeks. Some Algerian men might avoid prolonged eye contact with women and avoid personal questions. These behaviors are observed out of respect and to maintain appropriate social manners.\n[\n4\n]\nMost Algerians uphold Arab traditions of hospitality, and are friendly and helpful.\n[\n5\n]\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nneeds expansion\n. You can help by\nadding to it\n.\n(\nDecember 2008\n)\nMain article:\nAlgerian cuisine\nSee also:\nArab cuisine\nand\nFrench cuisine\nCouscous\n(\nArabic\n: \u0643\u0633\u0643\u0633) with\nvegetables\nand\nchickpeas\n, the national dish of Algeria\nAlgerian cuisine features cooking styles and dishes derived from traditional\nArab\n,\nAmazigh\n,\nTurkish\n, and\nFrench cuisine\n. The influence of\nJewish\n,\nSpanish\n,\nBerber\n, and\nItalian\ncuisines can also be observed.\n[\n6\n]\nThe cuisine is flavorful, often featuring a blend of traditional Mediterranean\nspices\nand\nchili peppers\n.\n[\n6\n]\nCouscous\nis a staple of the diet, often served with stews and other fare. Other popular Algeria dishes include\ndoulma\n,\nchakhchoukha\n, and\nchtitha\n.\nDress\n[\nedit\n]\nAlgerian clothing,  influenced by the country's rich history and cultural heritage, varies among different regions and communities in Algeria. Traditional Algerian clothing is\nIslamic custom\n, although there are Algerians who adopted clothing based on Western style, especially in the cities.\n[\n7\n]\nIn urban areas, there is a mix of traditional clothing and increasingly common Western style clothing, whereas traditional clothing is much more common in rural areas.\n[\n8\n]\nAs an Islamic country, Algeria has limits on dress code. Most Algerians follow Islamic dress codes, and foreigners are expected to show modesty, such as female visitors having to avoid exposing their shoulders, knees or chest.\n[\n9\n]\nOne of the most common traditional garments for both men and women in Algeria is\ndjellaba\n. The djellaba is a long, loose-fitting robe that typically reaches down to the ankles. It is made from various fabrics, such as cotton or wool. The djellaba usually has long sleeves and a hood, and it is often worn over other clothing. In rural areas, women often wear a traditional dress called\nhaik\n. The haik is a large rectangular piece of fabric, usually made of wool or cotton, which covers the body and is wrapped around the head as a hood. The haik is typically white, but it can also be found in other colors and patterns. It is of\nAndalusi\nArab origin.\n[\n10\n]\nThe traditional dress for men in Algeria includes a loose-fitting shirt called\ngandoura\n. The gandoura is usually made of lightweight fabric and is worn over\nsirwal\n. Men also wear a variety of head coverings, such as turbans or\nfez\nhats.\nIn urban areas and on special occasions, Algerians often wear modern Western-style clothing. However, traditional garments are still highly valued and are worn for cultural celebrations, religious events, and weddings. Other examples of traditional Algerian dress includes the\nqashabiya\n,\nkaftan\nand\nkarakou\n. In\nKabylia\nand the\nAur\u00e8s\n,\nBerber jewellery\nmade of silver, beads, and other items was an important component of\nBerber\nidentities up to the mid-20th century.\n[\n11\n]\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLiterature of Algeria\nMoufdi Zakaria\n, a 1908-1977\npoet\nfrom the\nAlgerian Revolution\nModern Algerian literature, split between\nArabic\nand\nFrench\n, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. Well-known poets in modern Algeria are\nMoufdi Zakaria\n, Mohammed Al Aid,\nAchour Fenni\n,\nAmar Meriech\n, and Azrag Omar.\nFamous novelists\nof the 20th century include\nMohammed Dib\n,\nAlbert Camus\n,\nKateb Yacine\n,\nAhlam Mosteghanemi\n, and\nAssia Djebar\n. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were\nRachid Mimouni\n, later vice-president of Amnesty International, and\nTahar Djaout\n, murdered by an\nIslamist\ngroup in 1993 for his secularist views.\n[\n12\n]\nIn philosophy and the humanities,\nJacques Derrida\n, the father of\ndeconstruction\n, was born in\nEl Biar\nin\nAlgiers\n.\nMalek Bennabi\nand\nFrantz Fanon\nare known for their writings on\ndecolonization\n.\nAugustine of Hippo\nwas born in\nTagaste\n(modern-day\nSouk Ahras\n), and\nIbn Khaldun\n, though born in\nTunis\n, wrote the\nMuqaddima\nwhile staying in Algeria.\nAlgerian culture has been strongly influenced by\nIslam\n. The works of the\nSanusi\nfamily in pre-colonial times, and of\nEmir Abdelkader\nand Sheikh\nBen Badis\nin colonial times, are widely known. The Latin author\nApuleius\nwas born in\nMadaurus\n(Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Algeria\nThe\nAlgerian musical\ngenre best known abroad is\nra\u00ef\n. Originating in western Algeria in the early 1900s as a combination of popular music and traditional\nBedouin\ndesert music,\n[\n13\n]\nit emerged as a major world-music genre in the 1980s.\n[\n14\n]\nIt is a pop-flavored, opinionated take on\nfolk music\n, performed by internationally-known talent such as\nKhaled\nand\nCheb Mami\n. It sounds like pop music, sung in Arabic with tonal and instrumental influences of traditional Bedouin music, as well as cultural and religious influences.\n[\n13\n]\nSingers of Ra\u00ef are called\ncheb\n(\nArabic\n: \u0634\u0627\u0628, or\nshabab,\nmeaning young) as opposed to\nsheikh\n(\nArabic\n: \u0634\u064a\u062e,\nshaykh\n, meaning old). Within Algeria,\nra\u00ef\nremains the most popular musical form, but older generations tend to prefer\nshaabi\n, performed by singers such as\nDahmane El Harrachi\n.\nAlthough\nra\u00ef\nis now generally welcomed and praised as a cultural emblem of Algeria, in the post-independence period the form was often attacked or criticised by Islamic and government authorities. These attitudes began to change around 1985, partially due to the influence of Colonel Snoussi, an ex-military officer turned\nra\u00ef\nartist.\n[\n15\n]\nAnother reason for the shift in attitude toward\nra\u00ef\nwas the music's growing popularity in France, which the Algerian government viewed as positive.\nAndalusi music\n, brought from\nAl-Andalus\nby\nMorisco\nrefugees, can still be heard in many older coastal towns.\nKabyle\nmusic, exemplified by\nIdir\n,\nAit Menguellet\n, or\nLoun\u00e8s Matoub\n, also enjoys a wide popularity.\nWomen in Algeria\n[\nedit\n]\nIn comparison to other\nMuslim\nmajority countries,\nAlgerian women\noverall have historically possessed more levels of freedom. Algerian women have seemed to be offered more leniency and have continuously proved to have an important voice in Algerian society.\n[\n16\n]\nHowever, while they seem to receive leniency, they still suffer from an overall lack of protection of legislation or cultural norms.\nExamples\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nneutrality\nof this article is\ndisputed\n.\nRelevant discussion may be found on the\ntalk page\n. Please do not remove this message until\nconditions to do so are met\n.\n(\nMarch 2024\n)\n(\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\nExamples of leniency can be depicted through women only having to wear their veils inside cities, not throughout their daily life regardless of their location. Historically, oppression of Algerian women grew during the French imperial period in 1965. Culturally, French influence caused Algerian men to have their voices oppressed and denied their pride, causing them to lash out in their domestic lives. However, this is not a direct representation of Algeria culture. The women's rights movement in Algeria continues to be a prevalent cultural movement to this day.\n[\n17\n]\nMedia\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMedia of Algeria\nVisual arts\n[\nedit\n]\n1910: a generation of precursors\n[\nedit\n]\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, artists mainly recuperated models and patterns imported\u00a0\u2013 or imposed\u00a0\u2013 by an imperialist French power.\n[\n18\n]\nAs\nEdward Said\nargued in his book\nOrientalism\nin 1978, Algerian artists struggled with the perception and representations of Westerners. Almost a century after the conquest by the French,\nAzouaou Mammeri\n(1886\u20131954),\nAbdelhalim Hemche\n(1906\u20131978),\nMohammed Zmirli\n(1909-1984), and\nMiloud Boukerche\n(1920\u20131979) were the first to introduce easel painting. They benefited from \"breaches\" in the educational system and were able to pursue a training in plastic arts. Even though they attempted to focus on the reality of Algerians' everyday routine, they were still to a certain extent incorporated in the orientalism movement.\nThe tradition of oriental illumination and\nminiature\nwas introduced around the same period, through artists such as\nMohamed Racim\n(1896\u20131974) or\nMohamed Temman\n(1915-1988). It is the two main expression of figuration in a country where popular abstract symbolic, Berberian or Arabic, are integrated mainly through architecture, furnitures, weaving, pottery, leather and metal workmanship.\nHow to reappropriate one's own history is a dynamic in Algerian contemporary art, reflecting on the deep social changes people experienced.\nArtists attempt a successful introspective work in which the duality in terms of identity creates a dynamic that overcomes \"orientalism\" and exotism. The main stake is for the artist and the spectator to reappropriate a liberty of expression and interpretation.\nMain artists of that period are:\nBoukerche\n,\nBenaboura\n,\nAli Ali Khodja\n,\nYelles\n, or\nBaya\n.\n1930: a generation of founders\n[\nedit\n]\nThe vast majority of the artists incorporate the thematic of the independence war, from those who lived it to the artists that use it as a legacy. Impregnated by all the artistic and ideological movements that marked the first half of the twentieth century, artists are concerned with the society they live in and denounce segregation, racism and injustice that divided communities of colonial Algeria.\nA clear shift in operated from orientalism and exoticism: new themes such as the trauma and the pain appear, for instance in the portrait\nThe Widow\n(1970) by\nMohamed Issiakhem\n.\n\"Art is a form of resistance as it suggests and makes visible the invisible, the hidden, it stands alert on the side of life\".\n[\n19\n]\nIt was also a time when Algerian artists start organizing themselves, through the National Union of Plastic Arts or UNAP (1963) for instance; artists such as\nMohamed Issiakhem\nor\nAli Khodja\nwere part of it.\nNon-figuration and \"Painters of the Sign\"\n[\nedit\n]\nAbdallah Benanteur\nand\nMohamed Khadda\nopened a path for\nabstract\n(non-figurative) Algerian art. They were French since childhood and emigrated to France. They were followed by artists such as\nMohamed Aksouh\n, Mohamed Louail,\nAbdelkader Guermaz\nand\nAli Ali-Khodja\n.\nMohamed Khadda\nwrote:\n[\n20\n]\n\"If figurative painting appears as\nthe norm\nin terms of expression, it is the result of an acculturation phenomenon\". Artworks liberately figurative are a form of liberation in that sense, as literal representations do not seem to fully emerge from the cluster of\nexotism\nand\norientalism\n.\nThe \"Painters of the Sign\" are Algerian artists born in the 1930s who, at the beginning of the 1960s, found inspiration in the abstract rhythm of Arabic writing. The term \"peintres du Signe\" was coined by the poet\nJean S\u00e9nac\nin 1970. He was hosting in\nAlger\nthe \"Gallerie 54\".  The first collective exhibition reunited\nAksouh\n,\nBaya\n,\nAbdallah Benanteur\n, Bouzid,\nAbdelkader Guermaz\n,\nKhadda\n,\nJean de Maisonseul\n,\nMaria Manton\n,\nMartinez\n,\nLouis Nallard\nand\nRezki Z\u00e9rarti\n. He wrote in his presentation: \"In this gallery 54, which aims at being a gallery of research in permanent contact with the people, we have brought together artists, Algerian or having deep links with our country\" \"We can assert, with Mourad Bourboune, that our artists do not only exhume the devastated face of our Mother, but, in the midst of the Nahda (renewal), they build a new image of the Man and stare endlessly at his new Vision\"\n[\n21\n]\nAouchem\n[\nedit\n]\nAlgerian artists reconnected with part of their historical and cultural legacy, especially the influence of\nBerber\nculture and language. A great deal of attention was brought upon the Berber culture and identity revendications after the\nBerber Spring\nin 1988, and it impacted the cultural production.\nDenis Martinez\nand\nChoukri Mesli\nparticipated in the creation of the group\nAouchem\n(Tattoo), which held several exhibitions in Algiers and\nBlida\nin 1967, 1968 et 1971. A dozen artists, painters and poets decided to oppose the mainstream organization of art\u00a0\u2013 especially of figurative art, they believe to be represented by the UNAP, the National Union for Plastic Art. They opposed their policy of excluding many active painters.  According to its manifesto\u00a0: \"Aouchem was born centuries ago, on the walls of a cave of\nTassili.\nIt continued its existence until today, sometimes secretly, sometimes openly, according to fluctuations of history. (...) We want to show that, always magical, the sign is stronger than bombs\".\n[\n22\n]\nIn spite of a surge of political violence following the war of independence, where the hegemony of the Arabic culture and language tended to overlap on the berberian culture, the plastic traditions of popular signs managed to maintain. Aouchem builds on this traditional legacy.\nNaivety and expressionism\n[\nedit\n]\nSince the 1980s, there has been a renewal and also a form of \"naivety\", trying to go past the trauma of the war and address new contemporary issues.\nBaya\n(1931\u20131998) is the example of a great Algerian success story.\n[\naccording to whom?\n]\nHer work was prefaced by\nAndr\u00e9 Breton\nand exposed by\nAndr\u00e9 Meight\nwhen she was still a teenager. She who has not known her mother as she was doubly orphaned by the age of 5, produced colorful watercolors with fake symmetries, questioning the figure of the Mother. She is part of the\nart brut\nmovement.\nExpressionism was dominated by\nMohamed Issiakhem\n, affectionately nicknamed \"Oeil de lynx\" (\nlynx eye\n) by his fellow writer\nKateb Yacine\n. When he was 15, he had an accident with a grenade. Two of his sisters and his nephew died, his forearm had to be amputated. His personal drama resonates in work.  He expressed themes like grief and loss through the use of thick pastes and universal figures; as an echo of the hardships of the Algerian war, as well as the universal struggle of those silenced and oppressed.\nRenewal of visual arts\n[\nedit\n]\nSince the 1980s, a new generation of Maghrebi artists has arisen. A large proportion is trained in Europe. Artists locally and among the Diaspora explore new techniques and face the challenges of a globalized art market. They are bringing together various elements of their identity, marked by the status of immigrant of first or second generation.  They address issues that speak to the Arab world with an \"outsider\" lens.\nKader Attia\nis one of them. He was born in France in 1970.  In a large installation in 2007 called\nGhost\n, he displayed dozens of veiled figures on their knees, made of aluminum foil.\n[\n23\n]\nAdel Abdessemed\n, born in\nConstantina\nin 1970, attended the\n\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts\nin\nAlgiers\n,\nAlgeria\nand then\nLyon\n,\nFrance\n. Through his conceptual artworks, he displays strong artistic statements using a wide range of media (drawing, video, photography, performance, and installation). In 2006, he exposed at the David Zimmer gallery in New York City. One of his artworks was a burnt car entitled\nPractice Zero Tolerance\n, a year after\nriots\nin France and in the midst of a resurgence of terrorist attacks since\n11 September 2001\n.\nKatia Kameli\n[1]\nalso brings in the multiple aspects of her identity and environment, through video, photographs and installations.\nCinema\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nneeds expansion\n.

Portugal\noccupied\nthe coastal enclave\nLuanda\n, and later also\nBenguela\n, since the 16th/17th centuries, and expanded into the territory of what is now Angola in the 19th/20th centuries, ruling it until 1975. Both countries share prevailing cultural aspects: the\nPortuguese language\nand\nRoman Catholicism\n. However, present-day Angolan culture is mostly native\nBantu\n, which was mixed with\nPortuguese culture\n. The diverse ethnic communities with their own cultural traits, traditions and native languages or dialects include the\nOvimbundu\n,\nAmbundu\n,\nBakongo\n,\nChokwe\n,\nAvambo\nand other peoples.\nEthnic groups and languages\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are over 100 distinct ethnic groups and languages/dialects in Angola. Although\nPortuguese\nis the official language, for many black Angolans it is a second or even third language. The three dominant\nethnic groups\nare the\nOvimbundu\n,\nMbundu\n(better called Ambundu, speaking Kimbundu) and the\nBakongo\n. There are also small numbers of Mesti\u00e7o (mixed African and European descent) and ethnic white Europeans as well.\nOvimbundu\n[\nedit\n]\nThe largest ethnolinguistic category, the Ovimbundu, were located in west-central Angola, south of Mbundu-inhabited regions. In 1988 the\nUnited States Department of State\nestimated that they constituted 37 percent of the population. The language of the Ovimbundu is\nUmbundu\n.\nThe core area of the Ovimbundu kingdoms was that part of the Benguela Plateau north of the town of Huambo. Expansion continuing into the twentieth century enlarged their territory considerably, although most Ovimbundu remained in that part of the plateau above 1,200 meters in elevation.\nLike most African groups of any size, the Ovimbundu were formed by the mixture of groups of diverse origin (and varying size). Little is known of developments before the seventeenth century, but there is some evidence of additions to the people who occupied the Benguela Plateau at that time. Over time, a number of political entities, usually referred to as kingdoms, were formed. By the eighteenth century, there were twenty-two kingdoms. Thirteen were fully independent; the other nine were largely autonomous but owed tribute to one of the more powerful entities, usually the\nkingdom of Bailundu\n, but in some cases Wambu or\nCiyaka\n. By the beginning of the second decade of the twentieth century, effective occupation by the Portuguese had caused a fairly rapid decline in the power of the heads of these kingdoms, but Ovimbundu continued to think of themselves as members of one or another of the groups based on these political units after\nWorld War II\n.\nIn addition, to the groups that clearly spoke dialects of Umbundu, there were two on the periphery of Ovimbundu distribution: the\nMbui\n, who seemed to straddle the linguistic boundary between the Ovimbundu and the Mbundu; and the\nDombe\nliving to the west near the coast, whose language was closely related to Umbundu, although not a dialect of it. The Dombe and several other groups, including the Nganda and the Hanya (who, according to one account, spoke Umbundu dialects) relied on cattle raising, as did their southern neighbors, the Herero and the Ovambo. Still others, typically the old tributary kingdoms, came to speak Umbundu relatively recently.\nUntil the Portuguese established firm control over their territory, the Ovimbundu \u2013 particularly those of the major kingdoms of Bailundu (to the northwest), Bihe (to the northeast), and Wambu (in the center) \u2013 played important roles as intermediaries in the\nslave\n,\nivory\n, and\nbeeswax\ntrades, acting as carriers, entrepreneurs, and raiders. With the decline of the slave trade in the last decades of the nineteenth century, the entrepreneurs among the Ovimbundu turned to the rubber trade, abandoning the warfare and raiding that had hitherto been integrally related to their economic activities. The\nrubber\nslump at the beginning of the twentieth century, the end of the de facto autonomy of their kingdoms not long after, and the displacement of Ovimbundu traders by the Portuguese forced these people to turn to cash-crop agriculture. (The men had hitherto had little involvement with cultivation; in fact, the women continued to be responsible for the cultivation of\nsubsistence crops\n.)\nThe introduction of\ncash crops\n, particularly\ncoffee\n, led to a series of changes in settlement patterns and social arrangements. But after a time, soil exhaustion, lack of support of African agriculture by the colonial authorities, incursions of Portuguese settlers who took over valuable property in the highlands, and a number of other factors contributed to a decline in the success of Ovimbundu cash-crop agriculture. By the early 1960s, up to 100,000 Ovimbundu, estimated at one-quarter of the group's able-bodied adult males, were migrating on one-year and two-year labor contracts to the coffee\nplantations\nof U\u00edge and Cuanza Norte provinces; another 15,000 to 20,000 sought work in Luanda and Lobito; and roughly the same number worked in the industrial plants of\nHuambo\nor for European farmers in the\nBenguela Plateau\n. In most cases, remuneration was low, but these migrant workers had little alternative. This pattern continued through the remainder of the colonial period, except for those males who were involved in nationalist activity (usually with\nUNITA\n).\nIn the 1940s, the Ovimbundu organized what was probably the most closely knit Angolan community of the colonial era. With the financial and ideological aid of North American\nChristian\nmissionaries, they established a network of Christian villages, each with its own leadership, schools, churches, and clinics. They were thus able to maintain the Ovimbundu culture while providing educational and social amenities for their children. The generation that emerged from this structure became the disciples of\nJonas Savimbi\nand the basis for UNITA, which in the 1980s used the same concepts to maintain Ovimbundu cohesiveness within UNITA-controlled areas.\nGiven the degree of change in Ovimbundu society and the involvement of the Ovimbundu with UNITA, it was difficult to determine their long-range role in Angolan politics. Just how long Ovimbundu solidarity would persist under changing circumstances could not be predicted.\nMbundu\n[\nedit\n]\nJust north of Ovimbundu territory lived the Mbundu, the second largest ethnolinguistic category, whose language was Kimbundu. In 1988 they made up an estimated 25 percent of the Angolan population. In the sixteenth century, most of the groups that came to be known as Mbundu (a name apparently first applied by the neighboring Bakongo) lived well to the east of the coast in the plateau region (at a somewhat lower altitude than the Ovimbundu); a few groups in the far northeast lived at altitudes below 700 meters. In general, the outlines of the area occupied by the Mbundu had remained the same. The major exception was their expansion of this area to parts of the coast formerly occupied by Bakongo and others.\nAlthough most of the boundaries of Mbundu territory remained fairly firm, the social and linguistic boundaries of the category had shifted, some of the peripheral groups having been variably influenced by neighboring groups and the groups close to the coast having been more strongly influenced by the Portuguese than were the more remote ones. Moreover, the subdivisions discernible for the sixteenth century (and perhaps earlier) also changed in response to a variety of social and linguistic influences in the colonial period. The Mbundu in general and the western Mbundu in particular, located as they were not far from\nLuanda\n, were susceptible to those influences for a longer time and in a more intense way than were other Angolan groups.\nThere were a number of Kimbundu dialects and groups. Two, each incorporating Portuguese terms, gradually became dominant, serving as\nlingua francas\nfor many Mbundu. The western dialect was centered in Luanda, to which many Mbundu had migrated over the years. The people speaking it, largely urban, had come to call themselves Ambundu or Akwaluanda, thus distinguishing themselves from rural Mbundu. The eastern dialect, known as Ambakista, had its origins in the eighteenth century in a mixed Portuguese-Mbundu trading center at Ambaca near the western edge of the plateau region, but it spread in the nineteenth century through much of eastern Mbundu territory. Another Kimbundu-speaking group, the Dembos, were generally included in the Mbundu category. Living north of Luanda, they had also been strongly influenced by Kikongo speakers.\nBy the late 1960s, the Mbundu living in the cities, such as Luanda and Malanje, had adopted attributes of Portuguese lifestyle . Many had intermarried with Portuguese, which led to the creation of an entirely new class of mesti\u00e7os. Those who received formal education and fully adopted Portuguese customs became assimilados.\nThe Mbundu were the\nMPLA\n's strongest supporters when the movement first formed in 1956. The MPLA's president,\nAgostinho Neto\n, was the son of a Mbundu\nMethodist\npastor and a graduate of a Portuguese medical school. In the 1980s, the Mbundu were predominant in Luanda,\nBengo\n, Cuanza Norte, Malanje, and northern Cuanza Sul provinces.\nBakongo\n[\nedit\n]\nYombe\n-sculpture, 19th century\nThe Kikongo-speaking Bakongo made up an estimated 15 percent of the Angolan population. In 1988 the Bakongo were the third largest ethnolinguistic group in Angola. Concentrated in U\u00edge, Zaire, and Cabinda provinces, where they constituted a majority of the population, the Bakongo spilled over into the nation of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\n(where they were the largest single ethnic group) and Congo. Although the Angolan city of S\u00e3o Salvador (renamed Mbanza Congo) was the capital of their ancient kingdom, most of the Bakongo were situated in Zaire.\nTheir former political unity long broken, the various segments of the ethnolinguistic category in Angola experienced quite different influences in the colonial period. The Bashikongo, living near the coast, had the most sustained interaction with the Portuguese but were less affected by participation in the coffee economy than the Sosso and Pombo, who were situated farther east and south. All three groups, however, were involved in the uprising of 1961. The Pombo, still farther east but close to the Zairian border, were much influenced by developments in the Belgian Congo (present-day DR Congo), and a large contingent of Pombo living in L\u00e9opoldville (present-day\nKinshasa\n) formed a political party in the early 1950s. The Solongo, dwelling on the relatively dry coastal plain, had little contact with the Portuguese. They and the Ashiluanda of the island of Luanda, to the south, were Angola's only African sea fishermen.\nThe Mayombe (also spelled Maiombe) of the mountain forests of Cabinda spoke a dialect of\nKikongo\nbut were not part of the ancient kingdom. That part of the Mayombe living in Zaire did join with the Zairian Bakongo in the Alliance of Bakongo (Alliance des Bakongo \u2013  Abako) during the period of party formation in the Belgian Congo, but the Cabindan Mayombe (and other Kikongo-speaking groups in the enclave), relatively remote geographically and culturally from the Bakongo of Angola proper, showed no solidarity with the latter. Instead, in 1961 the Mayombe formed a Cabindan separatist movement, the Alliance of Mayombe (Alliance de Mayombe \u2013 Alliama), which merged with two other Cabindan separatist movements in 1963 to form the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (Frente para a Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o do Enclave de Cabinda \u2013\nFLEC\n).\nOne of the first major revolts of the nationalist struggle was instigated by Bakongo in March 1961 in the northwest. The Portuguese crushed the peasant attack, organized by the Bakongo group, the Union of Angolan Peoples (Uni\u00e3o das Popula\u00e7\u00f5es de Angola  \u2013  UPA), on their settlements, farms, and administrative outposts. Subsequently, 400,000 Bakongo fled into Zaire. In 1962 the UPA formed the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (Frente Nacional de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola  \u2013  FNLA), which became one of the three major nationalist groups (the other two being the MPLA and UNITA) involved in the long and bloody war of independence. Most of the FNLA's traditional Bakongo constituency fled into exile in Zaire during the war. Following independence, however, many Bakongo exiles returned to their traditional homesteads in Angola. They had since retained their ethnolinguistic integrity.\nThe Bakongo are a matriarchal tribe, which means that the women have the authority and power in the tribe.\nLunda-Chokwe\n[\nedit\n]\nThe hyphenated category Lunda-Chokwe constituted an estimated 8 percent of the Angolan population in 1988. As the hyphenation implies, the category comprises at least two subsets, the origins of which are known to be different and the events leading to their inclusion in a single set are recent. The\nLunda\nalone were a congeries of peoples brought together in the far-flung Lunda Empire (seventeenth century to nineteenth century) under the hegemony of a people calling themselves Ruund, its capital in the eastern section of Zaire's\nKatanga Province\n(present-day Shaba Province). Lunda is the form of the name used for the Ruund and for themselves by adjacent peoples to the south who came under Ruund domination. In some sources, the Ruund are called Northern Lunda, and their neighbors are called Southern Lunda. The most significant element of the latter, called Ndembu (or Ndembo), lived in Zaire and\nZambia\n. In Angola the people with whom the northward-expanding\nChokwe\ncame into contact were chiefly Ruund speakers. The economic and political decline of the empire by the second half of the nineteenth century and the demarcation of colonial boundaries ended Ruund political domination over those elements beyond the Zairian borders.\nThe Chokwe, until the latter half of the nineteenth century a small group of hunters and traders living near the headwaters of the Cuango and Cassai rivers, were at the southern periphery of the Lunda Empire and paid tribute to its head. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Chokwe became increasingly involved in trading and raiding, and they expanded in all directions, but chiefly to the north, in part absorbing the Ruund and other peoples. In the late nineteenth century, the Chokwe went so far as to invade the capital of the much-weakened empire in Katanga. As a consequence of this Chokwe activity, a mixed population emerged in parts of Zaire as well as in Angola, although there were virtually homogenous communities in both countries consisting of Chokwe, Ruund, or Southern Lunda.\nThe intermingling of Lunda (Ruund and Southern Lunda) and Chokwe, in which other smaller groups were presumably also caught up, continued until about 1920. It was only after that time that the mixture acquired the hyphenated label and its members began to think of themselves (in some contexts) as one people.\nThe languages spoken by the various elements of the so-called Lunda-Chokwe were more closely related to each other than to other\nBantu languages\nin the Zairian-Angolan savanna but were by no means mutually intelligible. The three major tongues (Ruund, Lunda, and Chokwe) had long been distinct from each other, although some borrowing of words, particularly of Ruund political titles by the others, had occurred.\nPortuguese\nanthropologists\nand some others accepting their work have placed some of the peoples (Minungu and Shinji) in this area with the Mbundu, and the Minungu language is sometimes considered a transitional one between Kimbundu and Chokwe. There may in fact have been important Mbundu influence on these two peoples, but the work of a number of linguists places their languages firmly with the set that includes Ruund, Lunda, and Chokwe.\nEconomic and political developments in the 1970s affected various sections of the Lunda-Chokwe differently. Substantial numbers of them live in or near Lunda Norte Province, which contains the principal diamond mines of Angola. Diamond mining had been significant since 1920, and preindependence data show that the industry employed about 18,000 persons. Moreover, the\nmining\ncompany provided medical and educational facilities for its employees and their dependents, thereby affecting even greater numbers. How many of those employed were Lunda-Chokwe is not clear, although neighboring villages would have been affected by the presence of the mining complex in any case. In the intra-Angolan political conflict preceding and immediately following independence, there apparently was some division between the northern Lunda-Chokwe, especially those with some urban experience, who tended to support the MPLA, and the rural Chokwe, particularly those farther south, who tended to support UNITA. In the 1980s, as the UNITA insurgency intensified in the border areas of eastern and northern Angola, Lunda-Chokwe families were forced to flee into Zaire's Shaba Province, where many remained in 1988, living in three sites along the\nBenguela Railway\n. The impact of this move on the ethnolinguistic integrity of these people was not known.\nA somewhat different kind of political impact began in the late 1960s, when refugees from Katanga in Zaire, speakers of Lunda or a related language, crossed the border into what are now Lunda Sul and northern Moxico provinces. In 1977 and 1978, these refugees and others whom they had recruited formed the National Front for the Liberation of the Congo (Front National pour la Lib\u00e9ration du Congo \u2013 FNLC) and used the area as a base from which they launched their invasions of Shaba Province. In the 1980s, these rebels and perhaps still other refugees remained in Angola, many in Lunda Sul Province, although the Angolan government as part of its rapprochement with Zaire was encouraging them to return to their traditional homes. The Zairian government offered amnesty to political exiles on several occasions in the late 1980s and conferred with the Angolan government on the issue of refugees. In 1988, however, a significant number of Zairian refugees continued to inhabit LundaChokwe territory. The significance for local Lunda-Chokwe of the presence and activities of these Zairians was not known.\nNganguela\n[\nedit\n]\nNgangela\nis generic term for a number of closely related Bantu languages in south-eastern Angola spoken by the Ngonzelo, Luchazi, Nyemba, Luvale, Luimbi, Mbunda, Mbuela, Yauma and Nkangala ethnic groups.\nYauma language\nand\nNkangala language\nare in turn Mbunda dialects. Nkangala, Mbalango, Sango, Ciyengele (\"Shamuka\") and Ndundu are closely related.\n[\n1\n]\nOvambo, Nyaneka-Nkhumbi, Herero, and others\n[\nedit\n]\nIn far southwestern Angola, three categories of Bantu-speaking peoples have been distinguished. Two of them, the Ovambo and the Herero, were more heavily represented elsewhere: the Ovambo in\nNamibia\nand the Herero in Namibia and\nBotswana\n. The Herero dispersion, especially that section of it in Botswana, was the consequence of the migration of the Herero from German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) after their rebellion against German rule in 1906. The third group was the Nyaneka-Humbe. Unlike the other groups, the Nyaneka-Humbe did not disperse outside Angola. In 1988 the Nyaneka-Humbe (the first group is also spelled Haneca; the latter group is also spelled Nkumbi) constituted 3 percent of the population. The Ovambo, of which the largest subgroup were the Kwanhama (also spelled Kwanyama), made up an estimated 2 percent of the Angolan population. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the Kwanhama Kingdom of southern Angola was a powerful state involved in a lucrative trade relationship with the Portuguese, who, together with the Germans, occupied Kwanhama territory in the early twentieth century. In the 1980s, the Ovambo were semi\nnomadic\ncattle herders and farmers. The Herero constituted no more than 0.5 percent of the population in 1988. Traditionally, the Herero were nomadic or seminomadic herders living in the arid coastal lowlands and in the mountainous escarpment to the east in Namibe, Benguela, and Hu\u00edla provinces. Many Herero migrated south to Namibia when the Portuguese launched a military expedition against them in 1940 following their refusal to pay taxes.\nIn the southeastern corner of the country the Portuguese distinguished a set of Bantu-speaking people, described on a map prepared by Jos\u00e9 Redinha in 1973 as the Xindonga. The sole linguistic group listed in this category was the Cussu. The Language Map of Africa, prepared under the direction of David Dalby for the International African Institute, noted two sets of related languages in southeastern Angola. The first set included Liyuwa, Mashi, and North Mbukushu. These languages and other members of the set were also found in Zambia and Namibia. The members of the second set, Kwangali-Gcikuru and South Mbukushu, were also found in Namibia and Botswana. The hyphen between Kwangali and Gcikuru implies mutual intelligibility. Little is known of these groups; in any case, their members were very few.\nAll of these southern Angolan groups relied in part or in whole on cattle raising for subsistence. Formerly, the Herero were exclusively herders, but they gradually came to engage in some cultivation. Although the Ovambo had depended in part on cultivation for a much longer time, dairy products had been an important source of subsistence, and cattle were the chief measure of wealth and prestige.\nThe southwestern groups, despite their remoteness from the major centers of white influence during most of the colonial period, were to varying degrees affected by the colonial presence and, after World War II, by the arrival of numbers of Portuguese in such places as Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes (present-day Namibe) and S\u00e1 da Bandeira (present-day Lubango). The greatest resistance to the Portuguese was offered by the Ovambo, who were not made fully subject to colonial rule until 1915 and who earned a considerable reputation among the Portuguese and other Africans for their efforts to maintain their independence. In the nationalist struggle of the 1960s and early 1970s and in the postindependence civil war, the Ovambo tended to align themselves with the Ovimbundu-dominated UNITA. Many also sympathized with the cause of\nSWAPO\n, a mostly Ovambo organization fighting to liberate Namibia from\nSouth African\nrule.\nHunters, gatherers, herders, and others\n[\nedit\n]\nThroughout the lower third of Angola, chiefly in the drier areas, were small bands of people. Until the twentieth century, most of them were nomadic hunters and gatherers, although some engaged in\nherding\n, either in addition to their other subsistence activities or as their chief means of livelihood. Those who survived turned, at least in part, to cultivation.\nThe bands living a nomadic or seminomadic life in Cuando Cubango Province (and occasionally reaching as far east as the upper Cunene River) differed physically and linguistically from their sedentary Bantu-speaking neighbors. Short, saffron-colored, and in other respects physically unlike the Nganguela, Ovambo, and Nyaneka-Humbe, they spoke a language of the !Xu-Angola or Maligo set of tongues referred to as Khoisan or\nClick languages\n(the exclamation point denotes a specific kind of click), whose precise relations to each other are not yet fully understood by observers.\nSeveral other hunting and gathering or herding groups, the members of which were taller and otherwise physically more like the local Bantu speakers, lived farther west, adjacent to the Ovambo and Herero. These people spoke Bantu languages and were less nomadic than the Khoisan speakers, but they were clearly different from the Ovambo and Herero and probably preceded them in the area. As with most African art, the wooden masks and sculptures of Angola are not merely aesthetic creations. They play an important role in cultural rituals, representing life and death, the passage from childhood to adulthood, the celebration of a new harvest and the marking of the hunting season.\nAngolan artisans work in wood, bronze, ivory, malachite or ceramic mediums. Each ethno-linguistic group in Angola has its own unique artistic traits. Perhaps the single most famous piece of Angolan art is the Cokwe thinker, a masterpiece of harmony and symmetry of line. The Lunda-Cokwe in the north eastern part of Angola is also known for its superior plastic arts.\nOther signature pieces of Angolan art include the female mask Mwnaa-Pwo worn by male dancers in their puberty rituals, the polychromatic Kalelwa masks used during circumcision ceremonies, Cikungu and Cihongo masks which conjure up the images of the Lunda-Cokwe mythology (two key figures in this pantheon are princess Lweji and the civilizing prince Tschibinda-Ilunga), and the black ceramic art of Moxico of central/eastern Angola.\nMesti\u00e7o\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 1960 a little more than 1 percent of the total population of Angola consisted of\nmesti\u00e7os\n. It has been estimated that by 1970 these people constituted perhaps 2 percent of the population. Some\nmesti\u00e7os\nleft at independence, but the departure of much greater numbers of Portuguese probably resulted in an increase in the proportion of\nmesti\u00e7os\nin the Angolan total. In 1988\nmesti\u00e7os\nprobably continued to number about 2 percent of the Angolan population.\nThe process of mixing started very early and continued until independence. But it was not until about 1900, when the number of Portuguese in Angola was very small and consisted almost entirely of males, that the percentage of\nmesti\u00e7os\nin the population exceeded the percentage of whites.\nAfter a number of generations, the antecedents of many\nmesti\u00e7os\nbecame mixed to the extent that the Portuguese felt a need to establish a set of distinctions among them. Many\nmesti\u00e7os\naccepted this system as a means of social ranking. One source suggests that the term\nmesti\u00e7o\nused alone in a social context applied specifically to the offspring of a mulatto and a white; the term\nmesti\u00e7o cabrito\nreferred to the descendant of a union between two mulattos; and the term\nmestico cafuso\nwas applied to the child of a union between a mulatto and a black African. It is possible that an even more complex set of distinctions was sometimes used.\nMost\nmesti\u00e7os\nwere urban dwellers and had learned to speak Portuguese either as a household language or in school. Although some of the relatively few rural\nmesti\u00e7os\nlived like the Africans among whom they dwelt, most apparently achieved the status of\nassimilados,\nthe term applied before 1961 to those nonwhites who fulfilled certain specific requirements and were therefore registered as Portuguese citizens.\nWith some exceptions,\nmesti\u00e7os\ntended to identify with Portuguese culture, and their strongly voiced opposition over the years to the conditions imposed by the colonial regime stressed their rights to a status equivalent to that of whites. Before World War II, only occasionally did\nmesti\u00e7o\nintellectuals raise their voices on behalf of the African population. Thus, despite the involvement of\nmesti\u00e7os\nin the nationalist struggle beginning in 1961 and their very important role in the upper echelons of the government and party, significant segments of the African population tended to resent them. This legacy continued in the late 1980s because\nmesti\u00e7os\ndominated the MPLA-PT hierarchy.\nStarting in the late 1970s, an average of 50,000 Cuban troops and civilian technical personnel (the overwhelming majority of whom were male) were stationed in Angola. As a result, a portion of the nation's younger population was undoubtedly of mixed African and Cuban descent. This new category of racial mixture, however, had not been described by researchers as of late 1988, and no figures existed on how many Angolans might fall into this category.\nArchitecture\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nArchitecture of Angola\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Angola\nNational identity\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nAngolanidade\nBibliography\n[\nedit\n]\nCopp\u00e9, Margrit and Fergus Power (eds.)

She comes from a rural background that tended towards traditional African values. Her mother could not read English, and in most cases decision-making was done by men. She went on to become a lawyer with much of her education being done in the West. Her Western education caused a mixture of respect and suspicion.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n[\n4\n]\nAs a lawyer, she earned acclaim most for her stance on women's rights. She was the plaintiff in a case that allowed the children of women by foreign nationals to be considered\nBatswana\n. The tradition and law before this stated that nationality only descended from the father. She later became Botswana's first female High Court judge.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAs a novelist, she has had three books published.

The guitar was originally played in a manner similar to\nSegaba\nbut with a better rhythm due to plucking, almost completely replacing the violin-like Segaba until such prodigies of Segaba as\nRatsie Setlhako\nre-popularised Segaba in the 80s with the help of radio. In the absence of instruments a clapping rhythm is used in music with the typical chant and answer manner of singing.

There has been a push in recent years to focus on revitalizing the Botswana music industry instead of purchasing foreign releases. Most popular music in Botswana still comes from South Africa, United States, Europe or elsewhere in Africa.\nGumba-gumba\nis a form of modernized Zulu and Tswana music, mixed with traditional jazz; the word\ngumba\ncomes from township slang for party.\nHip hop\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nBotswana hip hop\nBotswana\nhip hop\ncrews include The Wizards, a long-standing crew that fuses hip hop with\nragga\nand\nR&B\n.

Artist\nVee\nis one of them and his version is known as Kwaito Kwasa, from a combination of Kwaito music with a Kwasa Kwasa rhythm and guitar.\nRock\n[\nedit\n]\nThe development of\nrock\nas a genre in Botswana has been a slow one. The music has however started to gain some momentum, partly due to the youth's exposure to mainstream media like\nMTV\n,\nChannel O\nand the internet. Metal Orizon, the country's first\nheavy metal\nband, was formed in the early 1990s.\n[\n6\n]\nThe native Batswana have since showed appreciation for this genre. Ever since the year 2000, a lot of bands have been formed. Most these have played locally and a few have toured southern Africa. Fans keep up to date with the music through word of mouth,\ntape trading\nand social networks, and there is a 50-minute show broadcast on national radio which plays metal music.\n[\n6\n]\nThe rock culture is now evidently recognised, with bands coming together to fight AIDS under a tour titled \"Rock Against AIDS\".\nNotable bands include:\nWrust\n- albums include\nSoulless Machine\n(2007) and\nIntellectual Metamorphosis\n(2013): the most popular metal band in Botswana, they have toured South Africa and have supported\nSepultura\n[\n6\n]\nMetal Orizon - one album (Miopic Illusion)\nNosey Road - several albums\nStealth\nStane\nSkinflint -\nMassive Destruction\n(2009),\nIKLWA\n(2010),\nGauna\n(2011)\nMusic institutions\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nNational Music Eisteddfod\nis held annually in\nSelebi-Phikwe\n.\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nReligion in Botswana\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nTuraki, Y.: 2006, Foundations of African Traditional Religion and Worldview (Word Alive Publishers, Nairobi).\n^\n\"Culture & History | Embassy of Botswana, Japan\"\n.\nwww.botswanaembassy.or.jp\n.

In Kirundi, the national language of Burundi, these ethnic groups are called miryango, which can be translated to clans or tribe.\n[\n1\n]\nPre-colonial society\n[\nedit\n]\nBefore colonization Burundi and Rwanda formed one kingdom,\nRuanda-Urundi\n. The Burundian part of society was ruled by Kings also called\nMwami\n.\n[\n2\n]\nThere are no records of discrimination during this time. Every clan was involved in royal duties, for inclusion purposes. While there were physical differences between clans, they all shared to same customs and beliefs.\n[\n3\n]\nColonial society\n[\nedit\n]\nBurundi's colonization started in the early 19th century, which is later than most African countries.\n[\n3\n]\nFirst, German colonizers were assigned Rwanda and Burundi at the Berlin Conference of 1884/1885.\n[\n1\n]\nBelgians than took over the colony after the\nWorld War I\n. Both colonizers implemented Christianity and a new hierarchical order, by making traditional ceremonies illegal and by creating a hierarchical order between clans.\n[\n3\n]\nPost-colonial society\n[\nedit\n]\nBurundi and Rwanda experienced multiple civil wars after their independence, and policies that were put in place by colonizers were kept. Hutus were subjugated to forced labor controlled by Tutsi clans. This created persistent underdevelopment of the clans and tensions that created civil wars.\n[\n4\n]\nBurundi gained its independence in 1962,\n[\n4\n]\nbut there are still post-colonial institutions present in a variety of traditional cultural and political centers.\n[\n5\n]\nChristianism is the main religion in the country, there are two main groups catholic and protestant, but there is also Islam, and different types of animism.\n[\n4\n]\nIn the Burundian population all clans still mainly speak Kirundi, and colonialism brought French and English. French is used by society in private and government institutions for communication, knowledge acquisition, and cultural production. Which undermines the local language and limits the population that can access these institutions.\n[\n6\n]\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nMusic of Burundi\nBurundi has a wide range of music, from traditional percussions to modern music. Drums are the main instruments in Burundi, because of the heritage of the\nRoyal Drummers of Burundi\n, a group of musicians that play the instrument, sing and dance. In the precolonial period, the drummers would often play for the Kings and royal families, Royal drummers would announce the beginning of the day and the ending of the day. They would also play during special spiritual events such as enthronements or the beginning of the agricultural season. To this day, Burundians still celebrate important events with drummers.\n[\n4\n]\nThe\nIntangible Cultural Heritage\nof UNESCO in 2014 added the drummers' practices to their list.\n[\n7\n]\nBurundian Drummers\nIn 2017, a decree was passed by the government, legally banned women from beating drums as it was explained to be a men's activity, despite the centuries-long tradition of female drum-players in the country.\n[\n7\n]\nBurundian women greet each other in an interlocking rhythmic vocal form called\nakazehe\n.\n[\n8\n]\nMedia\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the 1990s, Burundi had several private media companies that started broadcasting government events and started to publish subjects considered taboo like political violence and corruption.\n[\n9\n]\nIt started a liberation movement that resulted in tensions between the government and the media. \u00a0As most private media companies were and are funded by foreign aid, the government tried to exercise control by cutting the maximum funds that these companies could receive, obligating the companies to monitor the population, and making it legally difficult to have freedom of speech.\n[\n10\n]\nLiterature and oral tradition\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of writers from Burundi\nDuring the\n1972 genocide\n, many Burundians involved in\nhigher education\nwere killed, stalling written culture. This combined with the lower\nliteracy rate\nhave encouraged an adherence to Burundi's strong oral tradition, which relays history and life lessons through storytelling, poetry, and song.  This is evident in\nkivivuga amazina\n, an improvisational poetry contest played by cattle herders, in which they boast their abilities or accomplishments.\nSports\n[\nedit\n]\nFootball in Burundi\nSee also:\nFootball in Burundi\nFootball\nis a popular pastime throughout the country, as are\nmancala\ngames.  Many Burundians celebrate Christian holidays and Burundian Independence Day, though the largest celebration occurs on\nNew Year's Day\nwith feasting and traditional drumming and dancing.\nBurundi's women's national volleyball team lastly qualified for the\n2021 Women's African Nations Volleyball Championship\n.\n[\n11\n]\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nBurundian cuisine\nBurundian cuisine utilises maize and bananas as staple foods and often contains\nred kidney beans\n.\n[\n12\n]\nMeals are not usually accompanied by sweet foods or dessert.  During celebrations and gatherings, Burundians drink homemade banana wine and beer, sometimes drinking through straws from a single large container.\nIn some areas,\nbrochettes\nand\nfrites\nare a popular remnant of the\nBelgian\ncolonial period. The presence of\nLake Tanganyika\nadds fish such as\nngangara\nand\nmukeke\nto Burundian cuisine. A national brewery produces\nPrimus\nand\nAmstel\nbeers.\n[\n13\n]\nEducation and language\n[\nedit\n]\nCentral Bujumbura, capital of Burundi\nIn the public education system of Burundi, only one student out of 100 will be able to attend university. The public elementary schools are mostly taught in Kirundi with a few French classes, and secondary schools and universities are taught in French. It creates difficulties that result in the alienation of local communities, affecting girls more than boys. \u00a0Recently Burundi has added Kiswahili and English to the curriculum, creating an even wider gap in the population. For the past decade, there has been a shortage of staff, faculty, and material in the public sector as well.\n[\n14\n]\nVisual arts\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section is empty.\nYou can help by\nadding to it\n.\n(\nMay 2023\n)\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nFood portal\nList of African cuisines\nBibliography\n[\nedit\n]\nMarsh, Ian (2015).\nAfrica [3 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of Culture and Society\n: Bloomsbury Academic.\n[\n15\n]\nThis is an encyclopedia book that was published by an independent publisher.

The country is nicknamed \"Little Africa\" as geographically, Cameroon consists of coastline, mountains, grass plains, forest, rainforest and desert, all of the geographical regions in Africa in one country. This also contributes to its cultural diversity as ways of life and traditional food dishes and traditions vary from geographical region to geographical region.\nHolidays\n[\nedit\n]\nA musician plays traditional African music during the closing ceremony of French RECAMP-concept (reinforcement of African peacekeeping capacities) in\nDouala\n, November 23, 2006\nReligious holidays in\nCameroon\ninclude:\nChristian:\nGood Friday\n,\nEaster Sunday\n,\nEaster Monday\n,\nPentecost\n,\nAscension Thursday\nand\nPalm Sunday\nMuslim:\nEid ul-Fitr\n,\nEid ul-Adha\nand\nRamadan\nPolitics\n[\nedit\n]\nSince an amendment was added to the Cameroon Constitution in 1992, Cameroon has been a multi-party state, which means there are multiple parties that have the potential to gain power over the government. Cameroon's first president,\nAhmadou Ahidjo\n, was in power from 1960 to 1982.\n[\n1\n]\nThe president holds executive power for seven years, for a maximum of two terms. The president and his cabinet hold the main power at the national level, while at the local level, the\nprefet\nand\nsous-prefet\nhold the most power. Getting a government position can happen several different ways: Regional background, ethical background, party loyalty, and who you know. The national and local levels have been known to work together, even though they have to deal with their own separate issues from each other.\n[\n2\n]\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nReligion in Cameroon\nCameroon culture consists of numerous religions including\nChristianity\n(about 79%),\nIslam\n(about 21%), and many other\nindigenous religions\n. The citizens of Cameroon are entitled to\nfreedom of religion\n, as it is stated within their constitution. Therefore, citizens are free to practice any religion they choose, without harassment or forceful conversion. The northern part of Cameroon is heavily occupied by the\nFulani\npeople (\nFula\n:\nFul\u0253e\n;\nFrench\n:\nPeul\nor\nPeulh\n; also known\nMbororo\n, though this has sometimes been seen as pejorative\n[\n3\n]\n). The Fulani are mainly\nMuslims\n, because Islam is the dominant religion in the northern region. The western region is home of the\nBamum people\n, an ethnic group that also practices the Islamic religion. The French-speaking people are often inhabitants of the southern and western regions and the majority of them are\nCatholic\n, while English-speaking citizens more to the west tend to be\nProtestants\n.\nFashion\n[\nedit\n]\nCameroonian fashion is varied and often mixes modern and traditional elements. Note the wearing of\nsun glasses\n,\nMonk shoes\n,\nsandals\n, and a\nSmartwatch\n.\nCameroon's relatively large and diverse population is also diverse with respect to its contemporary fashion. Climate, religious, ethnic and cultural belief systems as well as influences from colonialism, imperialism and globalization are all reflected in the clothes worn by modern Cameroonians.\nNotable Cameroonian articles of clothing include:\nPagnes\n, a\nsarongs\nworn by Cameroon women,\nChechia\n, a traditional hat,\nKwa\n, a male handbag and\nGandura\n, male custom attire.\n[\n4\n]\nWrappers and\nloincloths\nare used extensively by both women and men but their use varies by region with influences from\nFulani\nstyles more present in the north and\nIgbo\nand\nYoruba\nstyles in the south and west.\n[\n5\n]\nImane Ayissi\nis one of Cameroon's top fashion designers and has received international recognition.\n[\n6\n]\nCulture and traditions\n[\nedit\n]\nCameroon has 250-300 distinct groups, and an estimated 300+ languages.\n[\n7\n]\nThese languages include the\nAkoose language\n, the\nGbaya languages\n, the\nFula language\n, the\nGyele language\n, the\nKoonzime language\n, the\nMundang language\n, the\nNgiemboon language\n, and the\nVengo language\n.\n[\n8\n]\nOthers include\nEwondo\n,\nBassa\n,\nBamileke\n,\nDuala\nand\nArabic\nin the North and Far-North regions.\nCameroon is divided into several provinces, which are dominated by specific ethnic or religious groups. Ethnic divisions often correspond to geography, which is also widely varied. Religious differences often correspond to colonial or other historical influence.\n[\n9\n]\nPartly through the influence of\ncolonialism\n, there is a national culture, and two distinct regional cultures: the Anglophone and Francophone regions, which primarily speak English and French and use different legal systems. The national culture is established through public institutions such as school, the multiparty political system, shared history of colonialism and a national love of\nfootball\n.\n[\n10\n]\nTheatre of Cameroon\nis also another important aspect of local culture.\nMedia\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMedia of Cameroon\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nCameroon\nCuisine of Cameroon\nLanguages of Cameroon\nMusic of Cameroon\nList of writers from Cameroon\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"Ahmadou Ahidjo\"\n.\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\n. 28 July 2023.\n^\n\"Culture of Cameroon - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family\"\n.\neveryculture.com\n.\n^\nMouiche, Ibrahim (2011).\n\"Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo in Western Cameroon\"\n.\nAfrica Spectrum\n.\n46\n(2):\n71\u2013\n97.\ndoi\n:\n10.1177/000203971104600203\n.\nJSTOR\n41336255\n.\n^\n\"Cameroon clothing - A description of the traditional attire of Cameroon\"\n.\nCameroon-Today.com\n.

However, the population tends to settle because today more than half of its citizens live in the capital and the towns and villages of the interior. This land, traditional crossing point between Egypt, Sudan and Saudi crossroads of nations between Africa and Asia, has likely undergone mixing of populations who have played an important role in the fate of the original peoples of the Djibouti nation. Poetry traditionally recited in the villages by special readers called gabaye was a way of recording the community's history and customs, as well as current events.\nEthnic groups\n[\nedit\n]\nAn\nIssa\nwoman in nomadic attire.\nAn\nAfar\nman in nomadic attire.\nDjibouti is a\nmultiethnic\ncountry. The two largest ethnic groups are the\nDir (clan)\nSomali (60%) and the\nAfar\n(35%). The\nSomali clan\ncomponent is mainly composed of the\nIssas\n, followed by a sizable group of\nGadabuursi\nand smaller numbers of\nIsaaq\n. Both are sub-clans of the larger\nDir\n; the Issas form part of the Madoobe Dir, while the Gadabuursi are part of the Madaluug Dir. The remaining 5% of Djibouti's population primarily consists of\nArabs\n,\nEthiopians\nand\nEuropeans\n(\nFrench\nand\nItalians\n). Most local residents are\nurban\ndwellers; the remainder are\npastoralists\n.\n[\n1\n]\nArabs\n[\nedit\n]\nDjiboutians have had expansive relations with the\nArab world\n, as is manifested in its adoption of\nArabic\nas an official language,\n[\n2\n]\nits location within the\nArabian Plate\n,\n[\n3\n]\nits membership with the\nArab League\n, its millennia-old trade relations with the peninsula's\nArabs\n,\n[\n4\n]\nand more recently, initiatives for a transcontinental crossing that would permanently link Djiboutians to the\nArabian Peninsula\n.\n[\n5\n]\nDjibouti has also hosted Arab refugees, primarily from Yemen.\n[\n6\n]\nSomali\n[\nedit\n]\nSomalis have traditionally been organized into nomadic pastoral clans, loose empires, sultanates and city-states.\n[\n7\n]\nTheir clan groupings are important\nsocial units\n, wherein membership plays a central part in Somali culture. Clans are\npatrilineal\nand are often divided into sub-clans, sometimes with many sub-divisions. Somali society is traditionally ethnically\nendogamous\n. So as to extend ties of alliance, marriage is often to another ethnic Somali from a different clan.\n[\n8\n]\nAfar\n[\nedit\n]\nAfar society has historically been organized into independent kingdoms, each ruled by its own\nSultan\n.\n[\n9\n]\nA portion of the community also consists of pastoralists, raising\ngoats\n,\nsheep\n, and\ncattle\nin the desert.\n[\n9\n]\nSocially, they are organized into clan families and two main classes: the\nasaimara\n('reds') who are the dominant class politically, and the\nadoimara\n('whites') who are a working class and are found in the\nMabla Mountains\n.\n[\n10\n]\nIn addition, the Afar are reputed for their martial prowess. Men traditionally sport the\njile\n, a famous curved knife. They also have an extensive repertoire of battle songs.\n[\n9\n]\nLanguages\n[\nedit\n]\nDjiboutian women dressed in traditional Afar and Issa tribal attire\nMain article:\nLanguages of Djibouti\nDjibouti is a\nmultilingual\nnation. According to\nEthnologue\n, the majority of the population speaks\nSomali\n(524,000 speakers) or\nAfar\n(306,000 speakers) as a first language, which are the\nmother tongues\nof the Somali and Afar ethnic groups, respectively. Both languages belong to the larger\nAfroasiatic\nfamily. There are two official languages in Djibouti:\nArabic\n(Afroasiatic) and\nFrench\n(\nIndo-European\n). Arabic is of social, cultural and religious importance. In formal settings, it consists of\nModern Standard Arabic\n. Colloquially, about 59,000 local residents speak the\nTa'izzi-Adeni Arabic\ndialect, also known as\nDjibouti Arabic\n. French was inherited from the colonial period and is the primary language of instruction. About 10,200 Djiboutians speak it as a first language. Immigrant languages include\nOmani Arabic\n(38,900 speakers),\nAmharic\n(1,400 speakers), and\nGreek\n(1,000 speakers).\n[\n11\n]\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nIslam in Djibouti\nand\nChristianity in Djibouti\nReligion in Djibouti\nreligion\npercent\nIslam\n94%\nChristianity\n6%\nWith few exceptions,\nSomali\nand\nAfar\nare entirely\nMuslims\n, the majority belonging to the\nSunni\nbranch of Islam.\n[\n1\n]\nThe constitution of Djibouti likewise defines Islam as the religion of the Republic of Djibouti. Islam entered the region very early on, as a group of persecuted Muslims had, at Prophet Muhummad's urging, sought refuge across the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa. Islam may thus have been introduced to the area well before the faith even took root in its place of origin.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nChristianity\nis a minority religion in Djibouti, with around 4,767 adherents.\nAttire\n[\nedit\n]\nIssa Somali man and woman in traditional attire (1844)\nWhen not dressed in western clothing such as\njeans\nand\nt-shirts\n, men typically wear the macawiis, which is a\nsarong\n-like garment worn around the waist. Among nomads, many wear a loosely wrapped white cotton robe called a tobe that goes down to about the knee, with the end thrown over the shoulder (much like a Roman\ntoga\n).\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nWomen typically wear the dirac, which is a long, light, diaphanous\nvoile\ndress made of cotton or polyester that is worn over a full-length\nhalf-slip\nand a bra. Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as shash, and also often cover their upper body with a shawl known as garbasaar. Unmarried or young women, however, do not always cover their heads. Traditional Arabian garb such as the male jellabiya (jellabiyaad in Somali) and the female\njilb\u0101b\nis also commonly worn. For some occasions such as festivals, women may adorn themselves with specialized jewelry and head-dresses similar to those worn by the Berber tribes of the\nMaghreb\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Djibouti\nDjibouti's various ethnic groups each have their own different styles of music and accompanying dances. Common instruments used by many of the communities are the drum,\ntanbura\nand\noud\n. Somali and Afar have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali and Afar folklore. Most Somali songs are\npentatonic\n; that is, they only use five\npitches\nper\noctave\nin contrast to a\nheptatonic\n(seven note) scale such as the\nmajor scale\n. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia,\nSudan\nor\nArabia\n, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between\nlyricists\n(\nmidho\n), songwriters (\nlahan\n) and singers ('\nodka\nor \"voice\").\n[\n14\n]\nSport\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nFootball in Djibouti\nFootball\nis the most popular sport in Djibouti.

A cradle of civilization,\nAncient Egypt\nwas among the earliest\ncivilizations\nin the world. For millennia,\nEgypt\ndeveloped strikingly unique, complex and stable cultures that influenced other cultures of\nEurope\n,\nAfrica\nand\nAsia\n.\n[\n1\n]\nEgyptian culture stands as a monumental testament to a rich heritage that has profoundly influenced the world since ancient times. For instance, the material and intellectual presence of Egypt lies at the heart of\nWestern culture\n, religion, and art, from antiquity to the present.\n[\n2\n]\nEgyptian culture is revealed not only in its breathtaking and historically rich monuments, such as the pyramids, temples, and religious structures, but also in its profound contributions to civilization. Their art, from intricate\nhieroglyphs\nto lifelike sculptures, reveals their profound understanding of their inherent aesthetics and symbolism. Egyptians pioneered advancements in mathematics, medicine, and astronomy, developed complex religious beliefs that shaped human history, and created one of the earliest and most sophisticated writing systems, which formed the foundation of modern alphabets.\n[\n3\n]\nFor over three millennia, Egyptian civilization flourished along the Nile, leaving a lasting legacy as its culture evolved. Egyptians themselves affectionately call their land 'Mother of the World,' a testament to its long and historically influential cultural significance. This significance arose from Egypt's central location in the\nOld World\n, where historical developments and interactions profoundly shaped its cultural fabric. The essence of Egyptian culture reflects its dynamic position within the\nEastern Mediterranean\n,\nNorth Africa\nand\nWest Asia\n.\n[\n4\n]\nLanguages\n[\nedit\n]\nArabic calligraphy\nhas seen its golden age in\nCairo\n.

Meanwhile, the\nEgyptian Arabic\ndialect or\nMasri\nis the official spoken language of the people. Of the many\nvarieties of Arabic\n, the Egyptian dialect is the most widely spoken and the most understood, due to the great influence of\nEgyptian cinema\nand the Egyptian media throughout the Arabic-speaking world. Today many foreign students tend to learn it throughout\nEgyptian songs\nand movies, and the dialect is usually labelled by the general public as one of the easiest and fastest to learn, mainly due to the huge amount of accessible sources (movies, series, TV shows, books, etc.) that contribute to its learning process.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nEgypt's position in the heart of the Arabic speaking world has made it the centre of culture and its widespread dialect has had a huge influence on almost all neighbouring dialects, having so many Egyptian sayings in their daily lives.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nHieroglyphs\n, as this example from a sarcophagus from\nThebes\nof about 530 BC, represent both\nideograms\nand phonograms.\nThe\nEgyptian language\n, which formed a separate branch among the family of\nAfro-Asiatic languages\n, was among the first written languages and is known from the\nhieroglyphic\ninscriptions preserved on monuments and sheets of\npapyrus\n. The\nCoptic language\n, the most recent stage of Egyptian written in mainly\nGreek alphabet\nwith seven demotic letters, is today the\nliturgical language\nof the\nCoptic Orthodox Church\n.\n[\n6\n]\nThe \"Koin\u00e9\" dialect of the\nGreek language\nwas important in Hellenistic Alexandria, and was used in the philosophy and science of that culture, and was later studied by Arabic scholars.\n[\n7\n]\nIn the upper Nile Valley, southern Egypt, around\nKom Ombo\nand south of\nAswan\n, there are about 300,000 speakers of\nNubian languages\n; mainly\nNoubi\n, but also Kenuzi-Dongola. In Siwa Oasis, there is also the\nSiwi language\nthat is spoken by about 20,000 speakers.

Religious literature is best known for its\nhymns\nto and its mortuary texts. The oldest extant Egyptian literature is the\nPyramid Texts\n: the mythology and rituals carved around the tombs of rulers. The later, secular literature of ancient Egypt includes the \"wisdom texts\", forms of philosophical instruction. The\nInstruction of Ptahhotep\n, for example, is a collation of moral proverbs by an Egto (the middle of the second millennium BC) seem to have been drawn from an elite administrative class, and were celebrated and revered into the\nNew Kingdom\n(to the end of the second millennium). In time, the Pyramid Texts became\nCoffin Texts\n(perhaps after the end of the Old Kingdom), and finally, the mortuary literature produced its masterpiece, the\nBook of the Dead\n, during the New Kingdom.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe\nMiddle Kingdom\nwas the golden age of Egyptian literature.

From this period comes the\nRosetta Stone\n, which became the key to unlocking the mysteries of Egyptian writing to modern scholarship. The city of\nAlexandria\nboasted its\nLibrary\nof almost half a million handwritten books during the third century BC. Alexandria's center of learning also produced the Greek translation of the\nHebrew Bible\n, the\nSeptuagint\n.\nAkhenaten, Dweller in Truth\n, a 1985 novel by Nobel Literature Laureate\nNaguib Mahfouz\n.\nDuring the first few centuries of the Christian era, Egypt was a source of a great deal of ascetic literature in the\nCoptic language\n. Egyptian monasteries translated many\nGreek\nand\nSyriac\nwords, which are now only extant in Coptic. Under\nIslam\n, Egypt continued to be a great source of literary endeavor, now in the\nArabic language\n. In 970,\nal-Azhar University\nwas founded in Cairo, which to this day remains the most important center of\nSunni Islamic\nlearning. In 12th-century Egypt, the Jewish\nTalmudic\nscholar\nMaimonides\nproduced his most important work.\nIn contemporary times, Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic-language literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated. The first modern Egyptian novel\nZaynab\nby\nMuhammad Husayn Haykal\nwas published in 1913 in the\nEgyptian vernacular\n. Egyptian novelist\nNaguib Mahfouz\nwas the first Arabic-language writer to win the\nNobel Prize in Literature\n. Many Egyptian books and films are available throughout the\nMiddle East\n. Other Egyptian writers include\nNawal El Saadawi\n, known for her\nfeminist\nworks and activism, and\nAlifa Rifaat\nwho also wrote about women and tradition.

The\nwall painting\ndone in the service of the\nPharaohs\nfollowed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Early Egyptian art is characterized by the absence of\nlinear perspective\n, which results in a seemingly flat space. These artists tended to create images based on what they knew, and not as much on what they saw. Objects in these artworks generally do not decrease in size as they increase in distance and there is little shading to indicate\ndepth\n. Sometimes, distance is indicated through the use of\ntiered space\n, where more distant objects are drawn higher above the nearby objects, but in the same scale and with no overlapping of forms. People and objects are almost always drawn in profile.\nPainting achieved its greats height in\nDynasty XVIII\nduring the reigns of\nTuthmose IV\nand\nAmenhotep III\n.

These were built with a distinctive repertoire of elements including\npylon gateways\n,\nhypostyle\nhalls,\nobelisks\n, and\nhieroglyphic\ndecoration. The advent of Greek\nPtolemaic rule\n, followed by\nRoman rule\n, introduced elements of Greco-Roman architecture into Egypt, especially in the capital city of\nAlexandria\n. After this came\nCoptic architecture\n, including\nearly Christian architecture\n, which continued to follow ancient classical and\nByzantine\ninfluences.\nFollowing the\nMuslim conquest of Egypt\nin the 7th century, Islamic architecture flourished. A new capital,\nFustat\n, was founded; it became the center of monumental architectural patronage thenceforth, and through successive new administrative capitals, it eventually became the modern city of\nCairo\n. Early Islamic architecture displayed a mix of influences, including classical antiquity and new influences from the east such as the\nAbbasid style\nthat radiated from the\nAbbasid Caliphate\n's heartland in\nMesopotomia\n(present-day\nIraq\n) during the 9th century. In the 10th century, Egypt became the center of a new empire, the\nFatimid Caliphate\n.\nFatimid architecture\ninitiated further developments that influenced the architectural styles of subsequent periods.\nSaladin\n, who overthrew the Fatimids and founded the\nAyyubid dynasty\nin the 12th century, was responsible for constructing the\nCairo Citadel\n, which remained the center of government until the 19th century. During the\nMamluk period\n(13th\u201316th centuries), a wealth of monumental religious and funerary complexes were built, constituting much of Cairo's medieval heritage today. The\nMamluk architectural style\ncontinued to linger even after the\nOttoman conquest of 1517\n, when Egypt became an\nOttoman province\n.\nIn the early 19th century,\nMuhammad Ali\nbegan to modernize Egyptian society and encouraged a break with traditional medieval architectural traditions, initially by emulating late\nOttoman architectural\ntrends. Under the reign of his grandson\nIsma'il Pasha\n(1860s and 1870s), reform efforts were pushed further, the\nSuez Canal\nwas constructed (inaugurated in 1869), and a new\nHaussmann\n-influenced expansion of Cairo began. European tastes became strongly evident in architecture in the late 19th century, though there was also a trend of reviving what were seen as indigenous or \"national\" architectural styles, such as the many\nNeo-Mamluk\nbuildings of this era. In the 20th century, some Egyptian architects pushed back against dominant Western ideas of architecture. Among them,\nHassan Fathy\nwas known for adapting indigenous vernacular architecture to modern needs. Since then, Egypt continues to see new buildings erected in a variety of styles and for various purposes, ranging from housing projects to more monumental prestige projects like the\nCairo Tower\n(1961) and the\nBibliotheca Alexandrina\n(2002).\nScience\n[\nedit\n]\nEgypt's cultural contributions have included great works of\nscience\n,\nart\n, and\nmathematics\n, dating from\nantiquity\nto modern times.\nTechnology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nAncient Egyptian technology\nImhotep\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nImhotep\nConsidered to be the first engineer, architect and physician in history known by name,\nImhotep\ndesigned the\nPyramid of Djoser\n(the\nStep Pyramid\n) at\nSaqqara\nin\nEgypt\naround\n2630\n\u2013\n2611 BC\n, and may have been responsible for the first known use of\ncolumns\nin\narchitecture\n. The Egyptian historian\nManetho\ncredited him with inventing stone-dressed building during Djoser's reign, though he was not the first to actually build with stone. Imhotep is also believed to have founded\nEgyptian medicine\n, being the author of the world's earliest known medical document, the\nEdwin Smith Papyrus\n.\nPtolemaic and Roman Egypt\n[\nedit\n]\nInscription referring to the Alexandrian library, dated AD 56\nThe silk road led straight through ancient Alexandria.

It is usually assumed to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC during the reign of\nPtolemy II of Egypt\nafter his father had set up the\nTemple of the Muses\nor\nMuseum\n. The initial organization is attributed to\nDemetrius Phalereus\n. The Library is estimated to have stored at its peak 400,000 to 700,000\nscrolls\n.\nOne of the reasons so little is known about the Library is that it was lost centuries after its creation. All that is left of many of the volumes are tantalizing titles that hint at all the history lost due to the building's destruction. Few events in ancient history are as controversial as the destruction of the Library, as the historical record is both contradictory and incomplete. Its destruction has been attributed by some authors to, among others,\nJulius Caesar\n,\nAugustus\n, and Catholic zealots during the purge of the Arian heresy, Not surprisingly, the Great Library became a symbol of knowledge itself, and its destruction was attributed to those who were portrayed as ignorant\nbarbarians\n, often for purely political reasons.\nA\nnew library\nwas inaugurated in 2003 near the site of the old library.\nThe\nLighthouse of Alexandria\n, one of the\nSeven Wonders of the Ancient World\n, designed by\nSostratus of Cnidus\nand built during the reign of\nPtolemy I Soter\nserved as the city's landmark, and later, lighthouse.\nMathematics and technology\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nGreek mathematics\nAlexandria\n, being the center of the Hellenistic world, produced a number of great mathematicians, astronomers, and scientists such as\nCtesibius\n,\nPappus\n, and\nDiophantus\n.

In this work, one of the most influential books of antiquity, Ptolemy compiled the astronomical knowledge of the ancient Greek and\nBabylonian\nworld. Ptolemy's other main work is his\nGeography\n. This too is a compilation, of what was known about the world's\ngeography\nin the Roman Empire in his time.\nIn his\nOptics\n, a work which survives only in an Arabic translation, he writes about properties of\nlight\n, including\nreflection\n,\nrefraction\nand\ncolour\n. His other works include\nPlanetary Hypothesis\n,\nPlanisphaerium\nand\nAnalemma\n. Ptolemy's treatise on astrology, the\nTetrabiblos\n, was the most popular\nastrological\nwork of antiquity and also enjoyed great influence in the\nIslamic\nworld and the\nmedieval\nLatin\nWest\n.\nPtolemy also wrote influential work Harmonics on music theory. After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argued for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (in contrast to the followers of Aristoxenus) backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the over-theoretical approach of the Pythagoreans). He presented his own divisions of the tetrachord and the octave, which he derived with the help of a monochord. Ptolemy's astronomical interests appeared in a discussion of the music of the spheres.\nTributes to Ptolemy include Ptolemaeus crater on the Moon and Ptolemaeus crater on Mars.\nMedieval Egypt\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nIslamic mathematics\nAbu Kamil Shuja ibn Aslam\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nAb\u016b K\u0101mil Shuj\u0101 ibn Aslam\nIbn Yunus\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nIbn Yunus\nModern Egypt\n[\nedit\n]\nAhmed Zewail\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nAhmed Zewail\nAhmed Zewail\n(\nArabic\n:\n\u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0632\u0648\u064a\u0644\n) (born February 26, 1946) is an Egyptian\nchemist\n, and the winner of the 1999\nNobel Prize in Chemistry\nfor his work on\nfemtochemistry\n.

Among the Fang of the mainland, witchcraft, traditional music (in which the Fang harp, the\nxylophone\n, the great drums, and the wooden trumpet are used), and storytelling survive.

Eritrea has nine recognized ethnic groups. Each group have their own unique traditions and customs but some traditions are shared and appreciated among different ethnic groups.\n[\n1\n]\nThe local culture consists of various, and often quite similar, traditions practiced by the nation's many\nCushitic\nand\nEthiopian Semitic\n-speaking\nAfro-Asiatic\nethnic groups, in addition to those practiced by the area's\nNilotic\nminorities. Eritrean culture is in some ways similar to the cultures of other countries in the region.\n[\n2\n]\nCoffee ceremony\n[\nedit\n]\nOne of the most recognizable parts of Eritrean culture is the\ncoffee ceremony\n.\n[\n3\n]\nCoffee (\nGe'ez\n\u1261\u1295\nb\u016bn\n) is offered when visiting friends, during festivities, or as a daily staple of life. If coffee is politely declined then most likely\ntea\n(\"shy\" \u123b\u1202\nshahee\n) will be served. The coffee is brewed by first roasting the green coffee beans over hot coals in a\nbrazier\n. Once the beans are roasted each participant is given an opportunity to sample the aromatic smoke by wafting it towards them. The coffee roasting smoke are sometimes used to fill the rooms with a pleasant scent. This is followed by the grinding of the beans, traditionally in a wooden\nmortar and pestle\n.\nThe coffee grounds are then put into a special vessel, called a\njebena\n, and boiled. A jebena is usually made of\nclay\nand has a spherical base, a neck and pouring spout and a handle where the neck connects with the base. When the coffee boils up through the neck it is poured in and out of another container to cool it, and then is put back into the jebena until it happens again. To pour the coffee from the jebena a filter made from\nhorsehair\nor other material is placed in the spout of the jebena to prevent the grounds from escaping.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe host pours the coffee for all participants by moving the tilted jebena over a tray with small, handleless cups (\nfinjal\n) without stop until each cup is full. Some of the coffee will inevitably miss the cup but this is done to prevent the coffee grounds from contaminating the brew. One extra cup is poured each time. The grounds are brewed four times: the first round of coffee is called\nawel\n, the second\nkale'i\n, the third\nbereka\n('to be blessed') and the fourth is called \"dereja\". However, the \"dereja\" is not always poured, it is mostly poured when elders are present. The coffee ceremony may also include burning of various traditional\nincense\nsuch as\nfrankincense\nor\ngum arabic\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nEritrean cuisine\nA plate of\nInjera\nwith various Eritrean stews\nTypically,\nEritrean cuisine\nconsists of various\nstews\n(\ntsebhi\n) made from vegetables and meat, and served atop a large, flat\nsourdough\nbread\ncalled\ninjera\n,\ntayta\n, \"shuro\", \"alicha\" and \"hamly\". Many\nvegetarian\ndishes are available since a majority of the population observe\nfasting\nat some time during the year. Eating is accomplished without\nutensils\nby tearing a piece of injera (strictly using the right hand), then scooping some stew, vegetables or salad with the bread.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nOn visiting an Eritrean household, it is polite to decline at least three times if asked to dine. Usually the host will say \"\nbezay kelalem\n\", after which the guest may agree to dine. This process ensures that one does not seem too eager to eat at another's household. When one visits an Eritrean house regardless of whether they are served with food or not, they are always served with hot tea.\nSuwa\nis the name for the home-brewed\nbeer\ncommon in Eritrea. It is made from roasted corn, barley and other grain and is flavored with\ngesho\n, a type of buckthorn leaf. The beverage is often made for celebrations; a sweet\nhoney wine\n(called Mies) is also commonly served.\nIn addition, Eritrean cuisine has a lot of\nItalian\ndishes from the\nItalian Eritrean cuisine\nintroduced  during\nItalian Eritrea\n. It is more common to find people eating the Italian Eritrean cuisine in the capital,\nAsmara\n. Asmara has been regarded as \"New Rome\" or \"Italy's African City\" due to its Italian influence, not only in the architecture, but also for the wide streets,\npiazzas\n(town squares) and\ncoffee bars\n. In the boulevards, lined with palms and trees, there are many Italian style bars,\nrestaurants\nand cafes,\n[\n4\n]\nserving\ncappuccinos\nand lattes, as well as\ngelato\nparlours. Many Eritreans drink the\nespresso\ncoffee, made using original Italian machinery. Pizza -the worldwide famous Italian food created in\nNapoli\n- is one of the favorite foods of the young people in Asmara.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Eritrea\nAn Eritrean\nkrar\nand\nmasinqo\nis a common instruments in Eritrea.\nEritrea has nine ethnic groups, each of which have their own different styles of music and accompanying dances. A common instrument used by many of the communities is the drum. Amongst the Tigray-Tigrinya, the best known traditional musical genre is called\nguaila\n.\nReligions\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nReligion in Eritrea\nThere are two major religions in Eritrea,\nChristianity\nand\nIslam\n. Pew research estimates that 63.5% are\nChristian\n, and 36.5% follows\nIslam\n,\n[\n5\n]\nIn 2010, the\nUnited States Department of State\n(USDoS) estimated that 65% of the population was Christian and around 35% was Muslim.\n[\n6\n]\nThe Muslims are concentrated in the eastern and western lowlands,& highlands whereas the Christians mainly inhabit the highlands. Religious denominations with fewer than 5% adherents include\nProtestants\n,\nSeventh-day Adventists\n,\nJehovah's Witnesses\n,\nBaha'is\n,\nBuddhists\nand\nHindus\n.

The culture of Swazi people involves music, food, religion, architecture, and kinship, among many other things.\n[\n1\n]\nThe Swazi people are composed of various Nguni clans who speak the Nguni language\nsiSwati\n. These people mostly reside in\nEswatini\nand\nSouth Africa\n. Presently, Swazi people may also include citizens of Eswatini. In Eswatini, one of the most visible features of cultural identity is the traditional political structure of the nation and the home. In the national level, the\nNgwenyama\n(the \"Lion\", or King) is considered the head of the nation alongside the\nNdlovukati\n(the \"She-Elephant\", or Queen Mother) who is the spiritual leader of the nation. National cultural events often involve the Ngwenyama or Ndlovukati. At home, the patriarch of the family is the head and often practices\npolygamy\n. This headman, usually referred to as\numnumzane\nis central to all activities of the home. A group of homes forming a community and the land they reside on forms a chiefdom or\numphakatsi\n. Several chiefdoms form an\ninkhundla\nwhich then belongs of a regional division of the country. This connects the older traditional leadership structures to more modern forms of government.\nThere are national cultural events such as\numhlanga\n,\nemaganu\nand\nincwala\nwhich take place at Royal residences of the Ngwenyama and Ndlovukati. Local cultural events in communities or\nimiphakatsi\n, take place at the residence of the chief also called\nemphakatsini\n. Weddings, funerals and religious events are usually carried out at family homesteads where neighbors are usually invited to partake.\nSwazi kinship\n[\nedit\n]\nA traditional homestead in Eswatini.\nThe principal Swazi social unit is the homestead, a traditional beehive hut thatched with dry grass. In a polygamous homestead, each wife has her own hut and yard surrounded by reed fences. There are three structures for sleeping, cooking, and storage (brewing beer). In larger homesteads there are also structures used as bachelors' quarters and guest accommodation.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nCentral to the traditional homestead is the cattle byre, or\nkraal\n, a circular area enclosed by large logs inter-spaced with branches. The cattle byre has ritual as well as practical significance as a store of wealth and symbol of prestige. It contains sealed grain pits. Facing the cattle byre is the great hut which is occupied by the mother of the headman.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe headman is central to all homestead affairs and he is often\npolygamous\n. He leads through example and advises his wives on all social affairs of the home as well as seeing to the larger survival of the family. He also spends time socialising with the young boys, who are often his sons or close relatives, advising them on the expectations of growing up and manhood.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nTraditional healers\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nSangoma\nis a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family. The training of the Sangoma is called \"kwetfwasa\". At the end of the training, a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing. The diviner is consulted for various reasons, such the cause of sickness or even death. His diagnosis is based on \"kubhula\", a process of communication, through trance, with the natural super-powers. The\nInyanga\n(a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms) possesses the bone throwing skill (\"kushaya ematsambo\") used to determine the cause of the sickness.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nIncwala\n[\nedit\n]\nSwazi warriors at the\nincwala\nceremony.\nWarriors in full incwala dress.\nThe most important cultural event in Eswatini is the\nIncwala\nceremony. It is held on the fourth day after the full moon nearest the longest day, 21 December. Incwala is often translated in English as 'first fruits ceremony', but the King's tasting of the new harvest is only one aspect among many in this long pageant. Incwala is best translated as Kingship Ceremony. When there is no king, there is no Incwala. It is high treason for any other person to hold an Incwala.\nEvery Swazi may take part in the public parts of the Incwala. The climax of the event is the fourth day of the Big Incwala. The key figures are the King, Queen Mother, royal wives and children, the royal governors (\nindunas\n), the chiefs, the regiments, and the \"bemanti\" or \"water people\".\nUmhlanga\n[\nedit\n]\nPrincess\nSikhanyiso Dlamini\nat the reed dance.\nGirls dancing at the 2010 reed dance.\nEswatini's best-known cultural event is the annual\nUmhlanga Reed Dance\n. In the eight-day ceremony, girls cut reeds, present them to the Queen Mother and then dance. (There is no formal competition.) It is done in late August or early September. Only childless, unmarried girls can take part. The aims of the ceremony are to preserve girls' chastity, provide tribute labour for the Queen Mother and to encourage solidarity by working together. The royal family appoints a commoner maiden to be \"induna\" (captain) of the girls and she announces over the radio the dates of the ceremony. She will be an expert dancer and knowledgeable on royal protocol. One of the King's daughters will be her counterpart.\nThe Reed Dance today is not an ancient ceremony but a development of the old \"umchwasho\" custom. In \"umchwasho\", all young girls were placed in a female age-regiment. If any girl became pregnant outside of marriage, her family paid a fine of one cow to the local chief. After a number of years, when the girls had reached a marriageable age, they would perform labour service for the Queen Mother, ending with dancing and feasting. The country was under the chastity rite of \"umchwasho\" until 19 August 2005.\nArts and crafts\n[\nedit\n]\nSwazi art varies from pottery to jewellery among many other things. Historically Swazi people have made jewellery and clothing items from beads. An example of this is\nligcebesha\n, a colourful necklace and\nindlamu\nand colourful skirt for girls.\n[\n2\n]\nHistorical pottery in Eswatini includes mostly clay pots that are used for carrying water, beer cooking and decorations. These clay pots are called\ntindziwo\n. Wooden sculptures were also very popular as utensils, for example\numcwembe\nused for serving meat. Swazis also made a lot of items using special grasses. These include grass mats called\nemacansi\nand\ntihlantsi\n. Other grass items are brooms, baskets among others.\nEswatini is also known for a strong presence in the handcrafts industry. The formalised handcraft businesses of Eswatini employ over 2,500 people, many of whom are women (per TechnoServe Swaziland Handcrafts Impact Study,\" February 2011). The products are unique and reflect the culture of Eswatini, ranging from housewares, to artistic decorations, to complex glass, stone, or wood artwork.\nSports culture in Eswatini\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nsport\nof\nfootball\nis the most popular sport in the country of\nEswatini\n.

The country's\nAfro-Asiatic\n-speaking majority adhere to an amalgamation of traditions that were developed independently and through interaction with neighboring and far away civilizations, including other parts of\nNortheast Africa\n, the\nArabian Peninsula\n,\nIndia\n, and\nItaly\n. By contrast, the nation's\nNilotic communities\nand other ethnolinguistic minorities tend to practice customs more closely linked with South Sudan or the\nAfrican Great Lakes\nregion.\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Ethiopia\nThis section\ndoes not\ncite\nany\nsources\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this section\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\n. Unsourced material may be challenged and\nremoved\n.\n(\nApril 2021\n)\n(\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\nThe music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of the country's ethnic groups being associated with their own sounds. Some forms of traditional music are strongly influenced by\nfolk music\nfrom elsewhere in the\nHorn of Africa\n, especially\nSomalia\n. In southeastern Ethiopia, in\nWollo\n, a Muslim musical form called\nmanzuma\ndeveloped in 1907. Sung in\nAmharic\nand\nOromo\nmost notably in\nDire Dawa\n,\nHarar\nand\nJimma\nwhere Ethiopian Muslims reside.\n[\n1\n]\nIn the Ethiopian Highlands, traditional secular music is played by itinerant musicians called\nazmari\n(Zageth), who are regarded with both suspicion and respect in Ethiopian society.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nChordophones\n[\nedit\n]\nA\nkrar\nplayer.\nIn the North, traditional string instruments include the\nmasenqo\n, a one-string bowed\nlute\n; the\nkrar\n(also known as kirar), and a large ten-string lyre. The\ndita\n(a five-string lyre) and musical bows (including an unusual three-string variant) are among the\nchordophones\nfound in the south. Also \"kebero\" ( a drum) used by the religious group like the Orthodox's or other Christian religious group to praise what they believe in.\n[\n4\n]\nAerophones\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nwashint\nis a\nbamboo\nflute\nthat is common throughout or in the highlands (Central and North).\nTrumpet\n-like instruments include the ceremonial\nmalakat\nused in some regions, and the\nholdudwa\n(animal horn; compare shofar) found mainly in the south. Embilta flutes have no finger holes, and produce only two tones, the fundamental and a fourth or fifth interval. These may be metal (generally found in the north) or bamboo (in the south). The Konso and other people in the south play fanta, or\npan flutes\n.\nIdiophones\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the\nEthiopian Orthodox Church\n, liturgical music employs the senasel, a\nsistrum\n. Additionally, the clergy will use prayer staffs, or\nmaqwamiya\n, to maintain rhythm. Rural churches historically used a\ndawal\n, made from stone slabs or pieces of wood, in order to call the faithful to prayer. The\nBeta Israel\nuse a small\ngong\ncalled a\nqachel\nas liturgical accompaniment, though qachel may also refer to a small bell. The toom, a\nlamellophone\n, is used among the\nNuer\n,\nAnuak\n,\nMajangir\n,\nSurma\n, and other Nilo-Saharan groups. Metal leg rattles are common throughout the south.\nMembranophones\n[\nedit\n]\nThe kebero (\u12a8\u1260\u122e) is a large hand\ndrum\nused in the Orthodox Christian liturgy. Smaller kebero drums may be used in secular celebrations. The\nnagarit\n(\u1290\u130b\u122a\u1275), played with a curved stick, is usually found in a secular context such as royal functions or the announcement of proclamations, though it has a liturgical function among the Beta Israel. The Gurage and other southern peoples commonly play the\natamo\n, a small hand drum sometimes made of clay.\nPopular music\n[\nedit\n]\nEthiopia is a musically traditional country. Popular music is played, recorded and listened to, but most musicians also sing traditional songs, and most audiences choose to listen to both popular and traditional styles. A long-standing popular musical tradition in Ethiopia was that of brass bands, imported from\nJerusalem\nin the form of forty Armenian orphans (Arba Lijoch)\n[\n5\n]\nduring the reign of\nHaile Selassie\n. This band, which arrived in\nAddis Ababa\non 6 September 1924, became the first official orchestra of Ethiopia. By the end of\nWorld War II\n, large orchestras accompanied singers; the most prominent orchestras were the Army Band, Police Band, and Imperial Bodyguard Band. Most of these bands were trained by Europeans or Armenians.\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, Ethiopian popular musicians included\nBizunesh Bekele\n,\nMahmoud Ahmed\n,\nAlemayehu Eshete\n, Hirut Bekele,\nAli Birra\n, Ayalew Mesfin,\nKiros Alemayehu\n,\nMuluken Melesse\nand\nTilahun Gessesse\n, while popular folk musicians included\nAlemu Aga\n, Kassa Tessema, Ketema Makonnen,\nAsnaketch Worku\n, and Mary Armede. Perhaps the most influential musician of the period, however, was Ethio-jazz innovator\nMulatu Astatke\n. Amha Records, Kaifa Records, and Philips-Ethiopia were prominent Ethiopian record labels during this era. Since 1997,\nBuda Musique\n's\n\u00c9thiopiques\nseries has compiled many of these singles and albums on compact disc.\nDuring the 1980s, the Derg controlled Ethiopia, and emigration became almost impossible. Musicians during this period included Ethio Stars, Wallias Band and Roha Band, though the singer\nNeway Debebe\nwas most popular. He helped to popularize the use of\nSem ena Worq\n(wax and gold, a poetic form of double entendre) in music (previously only used in qin\u00e9, or poetry) that often enabled singers to criticize the government without upsetting the censors.\nEthiopian traditional musical instrument called kirar\nContemporary scene\n[\nedit\n]\nPopular Ethiopian singer\nAster Aweke\n.\nPopular musicians from Ethiopia include internationally renowned and recognized artists such as the\nLos Angeles\n\u2013area expatriate\nAster Aweke\n,\nThe Weeknd\nand\nTeddy Afro\n, who is often accredited with the fusion of\nRastafarian\nstyles into mainstream Ethiopian music.\n[\n6\n]\nMore recently, music from\nTigray\nand\nEritrea\nhas become popular in Ethiopia and among exiles, especially in\nItaly\n. One of the biggest new trends, however, has been the rise of\nbolel\n, a sort of\nblues\n-like music, played by sarcastic azmari playing in parts of Addis Ababa, especially Yohann\u00e8s Sefer and Kazentchis. Bolel musicians include Tigist Assefa, Tedje and Admassou Abate.\nOther popular performers include Tewodros Tadesse, Neway Debebe, Ephrem Tamiru, Tadesse Alemu, Hamelmal Abate, Martha Ashagari, Yohannes Berhanu,\nKuku Sebsebe\n,\nAster Aweke\n, and\nManalemosh Dibo\n. Neway was very popular among the youth of the 1980s and early 1990s with such songs as \"Yetekemt Abeba,\" \"Metekatun Ateye,\" \"Safsaf,\" and \"Gedam,\" among others. Abatte Barihun has exemplified all four main\nqenets\non his 2005 album Ras Deshen.\n\u00c9thiopiques\nproducer\nFrancis Falceto\ncriticizes contemporary Ethiopian music for eschewing traditional instruments and ensemble playing in favor of one-man bands using\nsynthesizers\n. Harvard University professor Kay Kaufman Shelemay, on the other hand, maintains that there is genuine creativity in the contemporary music scene. She further points out that Ethiopian music is not alone in shifting to electronically produced music, a point that Falceto acknowledges.\nDance\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are many different types of\nEthiopian\ndances, each unique to the diverse regions of the country.\n[\n7\n]\nIn a 1964 ethnographic study, a Hungarian sociologist visiting Ethiopia recorded one hundred and fifty variations of Ethiopian dance using videos and photos.\n[\n8\n]\nThis study postulates that\nEthiopian\ndances can be divided into three forms: group dances, dances divided by gender, and coupled dances.\n[\n8\n]\nIn group dances, men and women gather and dance in ways that are not partnered or gender-specific. One such example is the traditional Amhara dance, eskista.\n[\n8\n]\nDances that have gender-specific movements include certain Oromo dances like the dances of Shewa/Tulama region in which men tend to have more stiff, jilted moves that mimic riding into war and emphasize physical power whereas women step to the same beat, but with an emphasis on technical and delicate neck movements. In most traditional Ethiopian dances, women tend to dance in ways that emphasize the movement of their neck and hair through the momentum of the bounce of their steps. Ethiopian dances usually involve short, repetitive movements of the legs, neck and shoulders. The speed and intensity of these movements varies depending on the rhythms being played.\n[\n8\n]\nThe third category of dance is the coupled dances. These dances involve partnership between a man and a woman, and often involve direct physical contact or a physical closeness that is coupled with complementary dance moves that create a sort of back and forth between the partners. One of the most popular coupled dances in Ethiopian traditional dance is the 'shagoyee' dance which originates from the Harerghe region of the Oromo ethnic group. In this dance, the male partner stands close and places his hands on the woman's shoulders and guides her from side to side, while the woman bends at the waist, twists, and fluidly swings her hair in the direction that her partner pushes her. Another popular coupled dance is called Awris, a playful traditional dance of the Tigre ethnic group. In this dance, the woman holds her arms near her chest, as if she is cradling a child, and glides around her partner while ducking and acting coy, while the partner gracefully leaps from one leg to the other and makes a motion of catching her.\nAs mentioned above, one of the most well-known traditional dances of Ethiopia is the\neskista\n, a dance that originates from the Amhara ethnic group. It is a shoulder-focused dance that involves the movement of the head, chest and neck as well.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nThe\neskista\nis known for its distinct use of vertical, sagittal, and diagonal shoulder movements.\n[\n9\n]\nBoth men and women use similar movements in this dance, and instead of partnership often has a competitive nature in how dancers mirror each other. Traditionally, the dance has been said to mimic rattlesnake shedding its skin due to the rapid and intensely controlled shaking of the upper body. Some forms of eskista also mimic a bird-like style that emphasizes both stiff and fluid neck movements which is characteristic of the Ethiopian dances in most parts of the country. On the contrary, the southern parts of Ethiopia tend to have dances that are more focused on foot and hip movements. For example, the Gurage region is known for its dances that incorporate a running-like motion in which the feet rapidly step in front of the other while staying in place. The Wolayta people are also known for their uniquely southern dance that focuses on the controlled toss of the waist and hips as the feet are held widely apart for a strong base. These different dances are an important part of the cultural expression of the Ethiopian people and their histories.\nClothing\n[\nedit\n]\nHabesha\nwomen in urban wear\nIn some central and northern areas, women's traditional clothes are often made from cloth called\nshemma\n. It is basically cotton cloth about 90\u00a0cm wide, woven in long strips which are then sewn together. Sometimes shiny threads are woven into the fabric for an elegant effect. It takes about two to three weeks to make enough cloth for one dress. The bottom of the garment or shirt may be ornamented with patterns.\nOmotic\nHamar\nwomen wearing their traditional attire\nMen wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white collar, and perhaps a sweater. They also frequently wear knee-high socks, while women might not wear socks at all. Men as well as women wear shawls, the\nnetela\n. The shawls are worn in a different style for different occasions. When going to church, women cover their hair with them and pull the upper ends of the shawl about their shoulders reproducing a cross (\nmeskelya\n), with the shiny threads appearing at the edge. During funerals, the shawl is worn so the shiny threads appear at the bottom (\nmadegdeg\n). Women's dresses are called\nhabesha kemis\n, and are often made from the shemma cloth. The dresses are usually white with some color above the lower hem.\nBracelets\nand\nnecklaces\nof\nsilver\nor\ngold\nare worn on arms and feet to complete the look. A variety of designer dinner dresses combining traditional fabric with modern style are now worn by some ladies in the cities.\nBody art\n[\nedit\n]\nIn May 2021, a public exhibition titled\nThe Wax and Gold of Hairstyles in Ethiopia\n, presenting historical photographs and modern drawings of traditional hairstyles was shown at the\nAddis Ababa Museum\n. This exhibition aims to invite the interested public to discover documentary photographs of people and their hairstyles taken by German\nanthropologists\nduring their field trips to southern Ethiopia between 1934 and 1971. These photographs and their original captions had been made available by the\nFrobenius Institute\nfor anthropological research of the\nUniversity of Frankfurt\nin Germany, as well as other institutions and scholars from Ethiopia and Germany. In June 2022, the exhibition was transferred to the city of\nJinka\nfor permanent display.\n[\n10\n]\nThe photographs and accompanying information of these forms of\nbody art\nin Ethiopia was also published online, with an exhibition catalog for free download.\n[\n11\n]\nEthiopian cuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nEthiopian cuisine\nAn Ethiopian woman preparing Ethiopian\ncoffee\nat a\ntraditional ceremony\n. She roasts, crushes and brews the coffee on the spot.\nThe\nEthiopian cuisine\nconsists of various\nvegetable\nor\nmeat\nside dishes and entrees, often prepared as a\nwat\nor thick stew like\ndoro wot\n; a very popular traditional stew made out of chicken and egg. One or more servings of wat are placed upon a piece of\ninjera\n, a large sourdough flatbread, which is 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0inches) in diameter and made out of fermented\nteff\nflour. One does not eat with utensils, but instead uses injera (always with the right hand) to scoop up the entrees and side dishes. Traditional Ethiopian food does not use any\npork\nor\nseafood\n(aside from fish), as most Ethiopians have historically adhered to\nIslam\n, the\nEthiopian Orthodox Church\n, or\nJudaism\n, all of which prohibit eating pork and shellfish. Additionally, throughout a given year, Orthodox Christians observe numerous\nfasts\n(such as\nLent\n), during which food is prepared without any meat or\ndairy products\n. Another dish served in Ethiopia is\nDoro wat\n, which is\nchicken\nstew with\nhard boiled eggs\n.\nEthiopian food prepared all in one\nA common ceremony of the culture is\ncoffee ceremony\n. Unlike most countries, coffee is served in presence of social gathering, in family, friend or neighborhood level. There are three rounds of coffee drinking: the first one called \"awol\" (\nTigrinya\n:\n\u12a3\u12ce\u120d\n), the second \"tona\" (\u1276\u1293) and the third \"baraka\" (\u1263\u122d\u12ab). The tradition of coffee legend goes back to Kaldi, a\ngoat herder\nfrom\nKeffa Zone\nwho noticed his goat was caught up with\nhysteria\nafter they eat shrub that stimulate them to dance uncontrollably with rampant. After holding berries, he was advised exhibit to priests in nearby monastery. One monk called the generosity of Kaldi \"the Devil work\" and tossed to the fire, generating aromatic odor. The legend told that Kaldi lived in 850 CE, commonly associated with belief of starting coffee cultivation in Ethiopia in the 9th century.\n[\n12\n]\nSports\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSports in Ethiopia\nFamous Ethiopian athlete\nKenenisa Bekele\nTrack and field\nis Ethiopia's most successful sport, in which they have won many medals in the\nOlympic Games\n.\nFootball\nis the most popular sport in Ethiopia.

There are nine radio broadcast stations, eight AM and one shortwave, licensed to operate. The major radio broadcasting stations (all AM) are\nRadio Ethiopia\n, Radio Torch (pirate), Radio Voice of One Free Ethiopia, and the Voice of the Revolution of Tigray. Television viewing has increased over the years and today there are a number of channels streamed via satellite television, such as Fana TV, EBS, Gospel TV, ETV 57 (government-owned), Kana TV, OMN, DM TV, and many more. In keeping with government policy, radio broadcasts occur in a variety of languages. Print media, because of high poverty levels, low literacy rates, and poor distribution outside of the capital, serve only a small portion of the population. Major daily newspapers include\nAddis Zemen\n, the\nDaily Monitor\n, and the\nEthiopian Herald\n. There is also a small but lively film industry.\nLanguage\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLanguages of Ethiopia\nLanguages of Ethiopia\nas of 2007 Census.\n[\n13\n]\nOromo\n(33.8%)\nAmharic\n(29.3%)\nSomali\n(6.25%)\nTigrinya\n(5.86%)\nSidamo\n(4.04%)\nWelaytta\n(2.21%)\nGurage\n(2.01%)\nAfar\n(1.74%)\nHadiyya\n(1.7%)\nGamo\n(1.45%)\nOther (11.6%)\nAccording to\nEthnologue\n, there are ninety individual languages spoken in Ethiopia.\n[\n14\n]\nThe majority of the population in the country speaks\nAmharic\n, the language of the\nAmhara people\n. Other regional languages, spoken by their respective ethnic include\nSomali\n, spoken by the\nSomali people\n,\nTigrinya\n, spoken by the\nTigray people\n, and\nOromiffa\n, spoken by the\nOromo people\n, Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afro-Asiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic\nSidamo\n,\nAfar\n,\nHadiyya\nand\nAgaw languages\n, as well as the Semitic\nGurage\n,\nHarari\n,\nSilt'e\nand\nArgobba\ntongues.\n[\n13\n]\nAdditionally,\nOmotic languages\nare spoken by Omotic ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions. Among these idioms are\nAari\n,\nBench\n,\nDawro\n,\nDime\n,\nDizi\n,\nGamo\n,\nGofa\n,\nMaale\n,\nHamer\nand\nWolaytta\n.\n[\n13\n]\nLanguages from the\nNilo-Saharan\nphylum are also spoken by the nation's\nNilotic\nethnic minorities, who are concentrated in the southwestern parts of the country. These tongues include\nNuer\n,\nAnuak\n,\nNyangatom\n,\nMajang\n,\nSurma\n,\nMe'en\nand\nMursi\n.\n[\n13\n]\nEnglish is the most widely spoken foreign language and is the medium of instruction in secondary schools. Amharic was the language of primary school instruction, but has been replaced in many areas by regional languages such as Oromiffa, Somali or Tigrinya.\n[\n15\n]\nWhile all languages enjoy equal state recognition in the\n1995 Constitution of Ethiopia\n, Amharic is recognized as the official\nworking language\nof the\nFederal Government\n. The various\nregions of Ethiopia\nare free to determine their own working languages,\n[\n16\n]\nwith Oromiffa, Somali and Tigrinya recognized as official working languages in their respective regions.\n[\n15\n]\nIn terms of\nwriting systems\n, Ethiopia's principal orthography is\nGe'ez\nor Ethiopic. Employed as an\nabugida\nfor several of the country's languages, it first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an\nabjad\nto transcribe the Semitic\nGe'ez language\n.\n[\n17\n]\nGe'ez now serves as the liturgical language of the\nEthiopian\nand\nEritrean Orthodox Churches\n. Unlike other regional languages, Amharic stands out as the sole language in the country with its own distinct alphabet and writing system, rooted in the ancient Ge'ez script.\nPhilosophy\n[\nedit\n]\nEthiopian philosophy\nhas been prolific since ancient times, though offset by\nGreek\nand\nPatristic\nphilosophy. The best known philosophical revival was in the early modern period figures such as\nZera Yacob\n(1599\u20131692) and his student\nWalda Heywat\n, who wrote\nHatata\n(\nInquiry\n) in 1667 as an argument of\nexistence of God\n.\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nGiyorgis of Segla\n, prolific religious author in the\nLate Middle Ages\nEthiopian literature\ntraces back to the Aksumite period in the 4th century, most of which are religious motifs. In royal inscription, they employed both\nGe'ez\nand\nGreek\nlanguage, but the latter was dismissed in 350 and the Amharic language rose up. Unlike most Sub-Saharan African countries, Ethiopia has ancient distinct languages, Ge'ez and Amharic which dominated political and educational aspects. In spite of the current political instability in the country instigates endangering cultural heritage of these works, some improvements are made for preservation in recent years.\n[\n18\n]\nThe Ethiopian literary works mostly consisted of handwritten\ncodex\n(branna, or \u1265\u122b\u1293 in Amharic). It is prepared by gathering parchment leaves and sewing to stick together. The codex size varies depending on volumes and preparation.\n[\n18\n]\nAnother notable writing book is a protective\nscroll\n, serving as written\namulet\n. Some of these were intended for magical purposes, for example\nketab\nis used for magical defence. Scrolls typically produced by\ndebtera\n, non-ordained clergy experts on\nexorcism\nand healings.\n[\n18\n]\nTsegaye Gebre-Medhin in 1980s\nIn Ethiopian\npoetry\n, most poets recount past events, social unrests, poverty and famine.\nQene\nis the most used element of Ethiopian poetry \u2013 regarded as a form of Amharic poetry, though the term generally refers to any poems.\n[\n19\n]\nThe most notable poets are\nTsegaye Gebre-Medhin\n,\nKebede Michael\nand\nMengistu Lemma\n.\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nReligion in Ethiopia\nAbout 63% of the population adhere to\nChristianity\n. About 34% of the population are\nMuslim\n, with other religions covering another 3%.\n[\n20\n]\nIn terms of faiths, Christianity (63%) and Islam (30%) are the two dominant religious affiliations in SSA.\n[\n21\n]\nGender roles\n[\nedit\n]\nIn rural and urban Ethiopia, the senior male of the household has the majority of authority. Men in the country side are in charge of tasks such as plowing, trading, building, and harvesting.\n[\n22\n]\nWomen are more responsible for the domestic labor of the household such as cooking, collecting goods, and caring for the household. It is also not unusual to see women helping men with some tasks in the countryside. In the urban areas, traditional gender roles are less common, but the women are, more often than not, still in charge of domestic labor. In Ethiopia education is still stressed more for boys compared to girls and also given more leeway to social activities over girls, though enrollment rate for girls in education is on the rise.\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nHolidays\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nPublic holidays in Ethiopia\nThere are a number of\npublic holidays in Ethiopia\n.

They are one of the few \u2800\u2800matrilineal\u2800\u2800 societies in West Africa. The Akan matrilineal system continues to be economically and politically important. Each lineage controlled the land farmed by its members, functioned as a\nreligious\nunit in the veneration of its ancestors, supervised marriages, and settled internal disputes among its members.\nOnce renowned for their splendor and wealth, the Akan kings retained dignitary status after colonization.\n[\n3\n]\nCelebration of the Akan kings lives on in the tradition of the\nGolden Stool\n. The Akan are noted for their expertise in several forms of craftwork, particularly their\nweaving\n,\nwood carving\n,\nceramics\n,\nfertility dolls\n,\nmetallurgy\n, and\nkente cloth\n). Traditional\nkente\ncloth is woven outdoors, exclusively by men, in complex patterns of bright, narrow strips. The manufacturing of many Akan crafts is restricted to male specialists. Pottery-making is the only craft that is primarily a female activity; men usually fashion pots or pipes depicting\nanthropomorphic\nor\nzoomorphic\nfigures.\nThe various Akan groups speak various dialects of the\nAkan language\n, a language rich in\nproverbs\n, the use of proverbs is considered a sign of wisdom.\nEuphemisms\nare also very common, especially concerning events connected with death.\nThe coastal Akans were the first to have relations with\nEuropeans\nduring the \"\nScramble for Africa\n\". As a result of this long association, these groups absorbed aspects of\nBritish\nculture and language. For example, it became customary among these peoples to adopt British surnames. The coastal Akans live predominantly in the\nCentral Region\nand\nWestern Region\nof Akanland.\nGa-Adangbe\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nGa-Adangbe people\nThe Ga-Adangbe people\nor simply\nGa people (named for the common proto-Ga-Adangbe ancestral language) inhabit the Greater\nAccra\nRegion.

The\nAdangbe\ninhabit the eastern plain, while the\nGa\ngroups occupy the western portions of the Accra coastlands. Both languages are derived from a common root language, and modern Ga and Adangbe languages are still similar today.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nDespite the archeological evidence that proto-Ga-Adangbe-speakers relied on\nmillet\nand\nyam\ncultivation\n, the modern Ga-Adangbe reside in what used to be fishing communities, and more than 75 percent of the Ga-Adangbe live in urban centers. The presence of major industrial, commercial, and governmental institutions in the city and towns, as well as the increasing\nmigration\nof other people into the area, has not prevented the Ga people from maintaining aspects of their traditional culture, even though\nTwi\nis an important\nimmigrant language\nin their lands.\nDagomba\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nDagomba people\nThe Dagomba speak\nthe Dagbani language\nand live in the Kingdom of Dagbon.

Many terms from\nArabic\n,\nHausa\n, and\nDyula\nare seen in the Dagbani language, due to the importance of\ntrans-saharan trade\nand\nWest African\ntrade and the historic impact that the\nIslamic\nreligion has had in the area.\n[\n6\n]\nEw\u00e9\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nEwe people\nThe\nEwe people\noccupy southeastern Ghana and parts of neighboring\nTogo\nand\nBenin\n. The Ewe follow a\npatrilineal\nstructure, meaning that the founder of a community becomes chief and is usually succeeded by his paternal relatives. Ewe religion is organized around a creator or deity,\nMawu\n, and over 600 other deities. The Ewe are more traditionally inclined in terms of religion and belief. Many village celebrations and ceremonies take place in honor of one or more deities.\nCoastal Ewe depend on the fishing trade, while inland Ewe are usually farmers and keep livestock. The local variations in economic activities have led to craft specialization. The Ewe also weave kente cloth, often in geometrical patterns and symbolic designs that have been handed down through the ages.\n[\n7\n]\nRole and status of women\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nWomen in Ghana\nWomen in pre-modern society were seen as bearers of children, retailers of fish, and farmers. Traditionally, women's childbearing abilities were perceived as a way for lineage ancestors to be reborn. In\npre-colonial\ntimes,\npolygamy\nwas encouraged, especially by wealthy men. In\npatrilineal\nsocieties,\ndowry\nreceived from marrying off daughters was traditionally seen as an acknowledgment to parents for raising their daughters well. In the last couple of decades, female gender roles have evolved tremendously. Ghanaian women now account for 43.1% of the working class in Ghana.\n[\n8\n]\nFemales have climbed to the upper leadership echelons of politics, career, business, and all other sectors. Notable political personalities include\nJoyce Bamford-Addo\n(Speaker of the 5th Session of the Parliament),\n[\n9\n]\nGeorgina Theodora Wood\n(Chief Justice)\n[\n10\n]\nas well as multiple past and current political office holders.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nFestival\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nAkwasidae Festival\n(alternate, Akwasiadae) is celebrated by the Ashanti people and chiefs in Ashanti, as well as the Ashanti diaspora. The festival is celebrated on a Sunday, once every six weeks.\nThe\nPanafest\ncelebrates\nroots\n, and\nAfrican-Americans\nwith roots from the region, often visit and celebrate their heritage.\nAshanti Yam Festival\nis observed for five days starting with a Tuesday, as dictated by the local chief priest. It marks the first harvest of yams during autumn, after the monsoon season. This festival has both religious and economic significance. Religiously, the festival is used to thank the gods and the ancestors for the new harvest and to traditionally outdoor the new yam.\n[\n11\n]\nThe Damba festival is celebrated by the people of\nDagbon\nand other ethnic groups in Ghana. During this festival, there is a colorful and vibrant display of the Ghanaian Smock and other traditional dresses.\nAlso, the Fire festival is celebrated during the first month of the Dagomba lunar calendar. This festival takes place at night and involves fire procession and drumming and dancing to war songs.\nWhen the first yam tubers are harvested, the people of Dagbon mark a ceremony to declare the opening of the yam season.\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Ghana\nThere are three distinct types of music: ethnic or traditional music,\n[\n12\n]\nnormally played during festivals and at funerals; \"\nhighlife\n\" music, which is a blend of traditional and \u2018imported\u2019 music; and\nchoral\nmusic, which is performed in concert halls, churches, schools, and colleges.\u00b0\nDance\n[\nedit\n]\nEach ethnic group has its traditional dances, with specific dances for different occasions. Some of these specific dances are meant for funerals, celebrations, storytelling, praise, and worship. There are various dances in Ghana performed by the ten regions across the country, most frequently during festivals and occasions such as funerals, marriage ceremonies, etc. These dances are performed to entertain and educate people.

Other dances in Ghana include kpalongo performed by the Gas, Agbadza by the Ewes, Adowa by the Akans, Bambaya by the Northeners, Patsa and Dbahsh by the Ga-Adangbes, and many others.

For a variety of illnesses, many Ghanaians turn to traditional medicine, frequently seeking the aid of herbalists and spiritual healers.\n[\n38\n]\nThis is especially true in rural areas, where there may be limited access to official healthcare facilities. But as the value of contemporary medicine is increasingly acknowledged, more people are using public health services, particularly for infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria. Although the Ghanaian government has made progress in enhancing healthcare infrastructure and access, issues like a lack of funding, a shortage of medical staff, and disparities in healthcare quality across regions still exist.\nMental health\n[\nedit\n]\nGhana faces many obstacles when it comes to mental health, one of which is the stigma associated with mental illness, which deters many people from getting treatment. There are few facilities for people in need of mental health services, and they are frequently concentrated in urban areas. Nevertheless, due to local and global advocacy, there is a slow movement to acknowledge mental health as an essential part of overall well-being. To address mental health issues, community involvement, and education are essential because they demystify mental illnesses and foster acceptance. The goal of recent efforts has been to incorporate mental health services into primary healthcare, highlighting the necessity of a more comprehensive approach to health that takes into account both physical and mental well-being.\n[\n39\n]\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nGhanaian cuisine\nThe cuisine has diverse traditional dishes from each ethnic group.

Music is used in many aspects of the culture; the\nDan\ncelebrate rice, death, marriage, birth, and weather all with music. Instruments include the\nTalking drum\n,\ndjembe\n,\nKpalogo\n,\nShekere (Youroo)\n,\nAkombe\n, and\ncleavers\n, and are typically made with local materials, such as gourds, animal skins, and horns. In the past, music has been the main\nfort\u00e9\nof one social group, the\ngriot\n(village entertainers). \nIvory Coast's\nAlpha Blondy\n, the world-famous\nreggae\nartist, is probably the country's best known singer, though his music is not necessarily representative.\nMasks are a prevalent art form in Ivory Coast. The variety and intricacy of masks created by the people of Ivory Coast is rivaled by none. Masks have many purposes. They are used mostly for representative reasons; they can symbolize lesser deities, the souls of the deceased, and even caricatures of animals. They are considered sacred and very dangerous; as such, only certain powerful individuals and families are permitted to own them, and only specially-trained individuals may wear the masks. It is held to be dangerous for others to wear ceremonial masks, because it is believed that each mask has a soul, or\nlife force\n, and that when a person's face comes in contact with the inside of the mask, the person is transformed into the entity the mask represents.\nThe\nBaoul\u00e9\n, the\nDan (or Yacouba)\nand the\nSenoufo\nare all known for their wooden carvings.\nContemporary art is well developed in Ivory Coast. Some of the major artists are:\nAnanias Leki Dago\n(photographer, 1970): Winner of the First Prize of PhotoAfrica context in Spain in 2009, and Distinction Award from the Critical Photography French Kodak Price in 2004\nChristian Lattier\n(sculptor, 1925\u20131978): Winner of the grand prize of \"World Festival of Black Arts\" in Dakar. 19 pieces of Lattier's sculptures are currently in the collection of the\nMus\u00e9e National de Ivory Coast\nin Abidjan.\nYacouba Konat\u00e9\n(curator, writer, art critic, professor of philosophy, 1953): In 2000, he served as a Director of the National Institute of Arts and Culture, and as a Director of the Cabinet of Ministers of Culture and\nFrancophony\n. He is also head of\nl'Institut national sup\u00e9rieur des Arts et de l'action culturelle\nof Abidjan. He was one of the curators of individual exhibitions of 6th\nDak'Art\nin 2004, and he was the artistic director of the\nDakar Biennale\nin 2006.\nJems Robert Koko Bi\n(sculptor, 1966)\nErnest D\u00fck\u00fc\n(Painter, 1958): D\u00fck\u00fc is an artist who have engaged in dialogue with the rich systems of graphic inscription and writing of Africa but his result are highly individual, his work ask the cosmogonical world system, the spiritual systems; by using his training in architecture may explain the volume and dimensionality that situates his works somewhere between painting and sculpture.\nOuattara Watts\n(painter, 1957): Watts is an internationally recognized neo-expressionist painter. Watts is a jazz enthusiast, who merged music and art in paintings and collages, by using recycled everyday materials.\nPaul Sika\n(fashion and advertising photographer/creative director/artist, 1985)\nMathilde Moraeau\n(painter): Director of the\nEcole Nationale des Beaux Arts\nin Abidjan\nSidiki Bakaba\n(actor, scenario writer, director, 1949): Awarded for his entire career in 2nd Pan-African Cultural Festival in\nAlgiers\nin 2009, and Best Actor for West Africa by\nla Fondation des artistes de Ivory Coast\n(FONDACI) in 2008\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bruly Bouabr\u00e9\n(painter, 1923, 2013): Many of his paintings are in the collection of\nJean Pigozzi\nEthnic groups\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nmay be in need of reorganization to comply with Wikipedia's\nlayout guidelines\n.\nPlease help by\nediting the article\nto make improvements to the overall structure.\n(\nApril 2012\n)\n(\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\nThere are more than sixty\nethnic groups\nin the Ivory Coast, the key ones being the\nBaoul\u00e9\nin the center, the\nAgri\nin the east, the\nSenufo\nin the north, the\nDioula\nin the northwest and west, the\nB\u00e9t\u00e9\nin the center-west and the\nDan-Yacouba\nin the west. \nOther groups, such as the\nAkan\nand their sub-groups the  Abron, Akye, Anye, and Aowin also make up a large part of the population.

Much of what we know about ancient Akan customs comes to us in the form of oral histories which have survived for several hundred years. Many of the objects that have been recovered through archaeological methods are still produced in modified form among Akan people today. The rise of the early Akan centralized state can be traced to the 11th century, which is the\nBono state\n, and is likely related to the opening of trade routes established to move gold throughout the region.\n[\n3\n]\nIt was not until the end of the 17th century, however, that the grand\nAsante\nKingdom emerged in the southern forest region of Ghana, when several small states united under the King of\nKumasi\nin a move to achieve political freedom from the\nDenkyira\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nBaoule\n[\nedit\n]\nThe [\nbaoule\n] people inhabit the Central Ivory Coast. Their population is approximately 4 million and the language is Baule (Akan cluster of\nTwi\n).\nArt\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Baoule create art in several different media, including gold and brass casting (similar to their Asante ancestors), wooden sculptures, and mask and figure carving such as wooden masks. The mask is a primary art form in the Ivory Coast. Baoule sculpture or masks are hidden from the public if the item holds high importance. Sacred sculptures are not raised off the floor and are covered in cloth. These sacred objects such as the\nGoli Glin Mask\ncan potentially harm a person if looked at.\n[\n4\n]\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nAncestor worship and a hierarchy of nature gods make up the religious beliefs of the Baule.\nAlouroua\nis the creator god, and though other nature spirits and spouses are represented in sculpture, Alouroua is never physically manifested in art.\nOther religion are also adopted in ivory coast. We have christianity and islam.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Baoule are a part of the Akan people who inhabit Ivory Coast and Ghana. The Baule migrated westward from Ghana when the Asante rose to power. This tale of their breakaway is preserved in their oral traditions. During the Asante rise to power, the Baule queen,\nAura Poku\n, was competing directly with the Asante king. When she lost, she led the Baule away from Ghana and to the Central Ivory Coast. Aura Poku's descendant occupies the throne and palace she built, and is honored by the Baule as their nominal king.\nEconomy\n[\nedit\n]\nMarkets, run primarily by women, are the center of the\nBaule\nlocal economy. Yams and some maize are the primary crops. They also export cocoa and koala nuts, using exploited\nmigrant laborers\n(mostly from\nBurkina Faso\n) on local\nplantations\n. Crops such as\nmaize\n, peppers, sweet potatoes, peanuts, tomatoes,\nmanioc\n, and squash were introduced from the Americas during the\nAtlantic slave trade\n. They raise farm animals, like sheep, goats, dogs, and chickens. Their craft items and local produce are sold along with\nimported goods\nall over the world.\nPolitical Systems\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nBaule\ngovernment is highly\ncentralized\n; there is a king or chief on top, who inherits his position, along with various subchiefs in charge of local populations. All rely on political advisors who aid in the making of decisions. The primary mask association, The\nGoli\n, provides social order among the\nBaule\n.\nAkye\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nAkye\nare an\nAkan people\nliving in the southern Ivory Coast, with a population of about 55,000. They speak\nAkye\n(\nAkan\ncluster of\nTwi\n).\nArt\n[\nedit\n]\nWoodcarving, pottery, and weaving are all art forms of the Akye. The stools carved are seen as \u201cseats of power\u201d and\nakuaba\n(wooden dolls) are associated with fertility. The traditions of pottery and weaving are extensive and long lasting throughout the Akan people. Woven on behalf of royalty,\nKente cloth\nhas come to symbolize African power all over the world.\nEconomy\n[\nedit\n]\nAlong the coast of the Ivory Coast, fishing is very important, as the\ndepleted forests\nhold little promise for hunting. The markets are run mostly by women who as a result hold a large amount of economic power, while the men fish, hunt, and clear land. Both participate in\nagricultural\ntasks.\nPolitical Systems\n[\nedit\n]\nRoyal membership among Akan is determined through connection to the land. Anyone who traces descent from a founding member of a village or town may be considered royal. Each family is responsible for maintaining political and social order within its confines.\nBono (Abron)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Abron are an Akan people living in the Northeastern Ivory Coast and considered as the earliest or one of the earliest Akan settlers in Ivory Coast. With an estimated population of 400,000. They speak the\nBono Twi\nof Akan. The Abron have a rich cultural heritage among the Akan.\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nAkan\nbelieve in an ultimate God, who has various different names depending on the different regions of worship. At one point, according to Akan mythology, this God walked upon the earth with man, but moved high up into the sky after being continuously beaten with a pestle of an old woman pounding\nfufu\n. No\npriests\nserve him directly, and the general belief is that he cannot be contacted directly. Priests do, however, serve other spirits, acting as a\nconduit\nof the gods, a liaison between them and mankind. There are numerous other gods (\nabosom\n), usually connected to the natural world, like ocean and river spirits, as well as a variety of local spirits who receive their power from this supreme god. The earth itself is considered a\ndeity\n, and a female one by the Abron called\nAsaase Yaa\n, directly connected to\nfertility\nand fruitfulness. Prayer is held daily, and includes offerings to ancestors and spirits.\nAnye\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nAnye people\nlive in the Southeastern Ivory Coast, with a population of approximately 1000 000. They speak\nAnyi\n(\nAkan\ncluster of\nTwi\n).\nArt\n[\nedit\n]\nFunerary images\nand\nmonuments\nhold special importance among the\nAnye\npeople; artistic expression is focused on creating such art forms, for the more beautiful the monument is, the deeper the respect for the deceased. Through these types of\ngrave monuments\n, dedicated to the\nancestors\n, families can demonstrate their affluence and dedication at the same time.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n3\n]\nOfficial Dakon History\n[\nedit\n]\nA subgroup of the\nAkan\n, the\nAnyi\npeople migrated to the Ivory Coast from\nGhana\nbetween the 16th and 18th centuries. They were never quite as powerful as the\nAsante\nand Baule, and as a result were indirectly under their respective rules at the height of both empires. The Baule Empire that rose up from 1720 between the\nBandama\nand the\nComoe\nRivers was the result of Family feud that arose between the then Queen Mother of Asante Nana Abenaa Pokua during the death of Nana Osei Tutu I and Her GrandNephew Nana Opoku Ware I who assassinated his Grand Uncle Nana Darko, the brother of Nana Abena Pokua. This incident brought about the civil war that engulfed the Asante Kingdom between 1717 and 1720 The incident split the Kingdom into two and the then united Oyoko-Dako Clan were also divided. The Oyokos who were the nephews of the Adakos, headed by Opoku Ware, kept control of Oyoko clan and the Golden Stool, whereas Nana Abena Pokua the QueenMother moved to Kaase (then Kwaman) with her partisans numbering about 3.5 million half the population of Asante moved and settled with the Anyi, Nzema and the Sanhwi to the west of Asante. Nana Opoku Ware was entooled as Asantehene and his mother Nana Nyarko Kusi Amoa, the niece of Nana Abena Pokua was also entooled as the Queen mother of Asante in 1720.\nBetween 1720 and 1730 Nana Abena Pokua, faced with many obstacles, confronted life with determination, living among the Nzima/Anyi and Safwi, She adopted their language and even changed her name from Abena Pokuaa to Abla Poku thus delinking any ties with Asante. Nana Abla Pokou in order to cross the River Comoe to escape the partisans of Opoku Ware who were sent to return the partisans of Nana Pokou back into the Asante Kingdom, had to sacrifice her son to the River Comoe before they were able to cross the river with her partisans. After crossing the River Comoe Nana Abla Pokou and her various warrior Groups started to settle each to ts location. The Kyidom warriors (Akye) settled immediately after the river Comoe to guide the route to Asante. They kept the Golden UMBRELLA and the sword of Nana Osei Tutu. The Abbe (Torchbearers) also settled after the Akye and the Mbatto, Ebrie and all the other foot Soldiers settled in the regions that is today Akan land in Ivory Coast.\nIn accordance to Akan tradition, after the consolidation of the new Kingdom, after meeting fierce resistance from the defeated former Lords of the Akan, the Denkyira; Nana Abena Pokua defeated them in war and subdued them and thereby established the Baule Kingdom. By 1730 Nana Abla Powas entooled as the First Reigning Queen of the New Akan Kingdom of Baule after the death of Nana Osei Tutu I. thereby with the stools of Obiri Yeboah and DENKYIRA UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE NEW KINGDOM, Nana Poukou established Baule Dakon Clan as the undisputed leader and Ruler of the Akans. Below are the Ruling Akan Rulers who ruled after the death of Nana Osei Tutu I, King of the Asantes and the Baules.\nBeretuo Dynasty 1717 to 1720 Amaniampon, the Mamponghene Regent, Mamponghene became regent due to the assassination of Nana Dako during the contest for the Succession to the throne after the death of King Osei Tutu the civil that ensued lasted for 3 years 1717\u20131720 that led to the migration of Nana Abena Pokua and the Adako Dynasty to Cote d\u2019lvoire and the founding of the Baule Kingdom.\nADAKO ROYAL Dynasty Obaahemaa Nana Abena Pokua BAULE Confederation\n1720\u20131730 nation building Founded the Baule Kingdom\nThat covered all the Akans in Cote d\u2019lvoire.\n1730 to 1760 NANA ABENAA POKUAA  (ABLA POKU) AWURAPOKU.)\n1760 to 1790 NANA AKUA BONI\n1790 to 1840 NANA KOUAME TUTU\n1840 to 1870 NANA KOUAKOU ANOUGBLE I\n1870 to 1880 NANA TUTU DIBI (TUTU YEMAN)\n1880 to 1890 NANA ANOUBGLE DEIKYE\n1890 to 1902 NANA KOUAME GUIE (AGYEI)\n1902 to 1925 NANA KOUADIO NDRI\n1925 to 1958 NANA KOUAKOU ANOUGBLE 11\n1958 to 1978 NANA KOUAME GUIE\n1958 to 1993 NANA HOUPHOUET BOIGNY governed as Akan king and President\n1993 to 2004 Nana Jean Baptist Kouame was nominated and enstooled as regent Nana Osei Tutu Anougble III Regent of the Baoule\n1993 to Present Odomankoma Akoa Nana Baffour Gyanko Fofie was entooled as supreme head of Adako RoyalDynasty\n1999 to Present Nana Baffour Gyanko Fofie I Nominated The Adako Akan Baule Monarch Awaiting Coronation when Peace and Calm Returns to the Nation.\nEconomy\n[\nedit\n]\nAnyi agricultural economy revolves around banana and\ntaro\nproduction. Yams are also an important staple crop in the region.\nPalm oil\nis also sold as a commodity at the international market.\nPolitical Systems\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nAnyi\nlive in loose, spread out neighborhoods of family housing complexes, usually with a\nheadman\n, directed by a Council of Elders who represents the town in regional politics. The\nAnyi\n, like other\nAkan\npeople, have a highly\nstratified\nsociety including a\nhierarchical\npolitical administration made up of officials with rank and power. Since the Anyi are\nmatrilineal\n, women have relatively high social status in both the political and economic areas.\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nAncestors and\nancestor worship\nare at the center of the Anyi's religious beliefs. One should always remember and honor one's ancestors, and strive to live life so that, in turn, as an ancestor one will be revered and remembered. In keeping with this system, when a person passes, there is an elaborate ceremony with\nritual washing\n, dressing the dead in fine clothes and gold jewelry, and a mourning period allowing the family to show respect for departed and to allow a safe passage and welcome for the deceased into the spirit world.\nAowin\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nAowin\npeople live in the Southern Ivory Coast and Southern\nGhana\n. They have a population of about 40,000 people, and speak\nAowin\n(\nAkan\ncluster of\nTwi\n). Their culture is very similar to the other\nAkan\ncultures in the area.\nDan\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nDan\nare a people who inhabit\nLiberia\nand the\nIvory Coast\n. They have a population of about 35,000 and speak\nDan\n(\nMande\n). \nArt and music are enormous parts of Dan culture. The primary art form of the Dan is their\nmasks\n, which emulate virtually every aspect of Dan society. Dan sculptors use masks to represent war, peace,\nsocial regulation\n, and entertainment.\nMancala\ngame boards and stylized wooden spoons are also made with wood carving.\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Dan world view holds that everything can be divided into two separate and clear categories. The primary\ndichotomy\nis between village and bush, in other words, things that have been controlled by man and things that have not. Crossing over the dividing line is dangerous business, and whenever it is done, whether to clear new fields or simply crossing the forest, the bush spirits must be appeased. In order to take part in village life, the bush spirits must take\ncorporeal\nform. The Dan believe that all creatures have a spirit soul (\ndu\n), which is imparted onto humans and animals from the creator god,\nXra\n, through birth. One's du is\nimmortal\nand is passed on after death to a new being. However, some du remain bodiless. They inhabit the forests as\nbush spirits\nand must establish a relationship with a person if they wish to be manifested and honored. Often the spirit will request the chosen person to dance the spirit, utilizing a mask to illustrate the spirit's embodiment.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nOral traditions\ndescribe the\nDan\nsociety of the 19th century as lacking any central governing power. Social cohesion was fostered by a shared language and a preference for intermarriage. Generally, each village had a headman who had earned his position of advantage in the community through hard work in the fields and through luck as a hunter. They usually surrounded themselves with young warriors for protection from invading neighbors and exchanged gifts with other\nchiefs\nin order to heighten their own prestige. Out of this custom was born the basic tradition of\ntin\namong the\nDan\n, which was based on displaying one's success in order to build a good reputation and name.\nEconomy\n[\nedit\n]\nThe tradition of\ntin\nis still an essential part of the Dan economy today. Young people strive to make a name for themselves by lavishly spending at community feasts to demonstrate their wealth. Although farming and hunting have been largely replaced by laboring in the\ndiamond camps\nor working at the\nrubber plantations\n, the establishment of a hierarchical social order is still based on the individual's ability to succeed.\nPolitical Systems\n[\nedit\n]\nIt has been only recently, through the creation of the\nleopard society\n(go), that a unifying political organization has emerged among the Dan. The secret political society centers around the powerful spirit go, who is responsible for peacemaking. Although the power of go seems to be increasing throughout Dan society, individual villages still maintain a high degree of political independence, and the economic power of the individual is still highly valued.\nSenufo\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nSenufo people\ninhabit northern\nIvory Coast\nand\nMali\n. They are also experts in making\nkorhogo cloth\n.\nArt\n[\nedit\n]\nMuch of the Senufo's sculpted work is made in the\nporo\n, or school.\nBrass sculptures\n,\nwood carvings\n, and masks are mostly made there, and sold to local artisans. They are expert mask makers, but since farming is the highest profession possible, artists and musicians are low in the\ncaste system\n(musicians are bottom).\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Senufo are made up of a number of different groups who migrated south to Mali and the Ivory Coast in the 15th and 16th centuries.\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nReligion in Ivory Coast\nThe Senufo are a very\nanimistic\nsociety; they believe that the\nancestor spirits\nare responsible for all events that occur, and if they are not appeased through proper\nritual\nthey may cause drought,\ninfertility\n, and illness.\nPolitical System/Economy\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Senufo are known as excellent farmers, and are mainly a farming society. They live by a strict\ncaste system\n, where the farmer is top and the musicians are at the bottom, everyone else filling in between. One of the highest possible honors given in the Senefo culture is the title of\nsambali\n(champion cultivator), who is respected throughout the region and in his old age is typically given a strong leadership role. Even for those who do not belong to the farmer\ncaste\n, farming is huge in the Senefo\nculture\n. The society is very community centered; people often take turns working each other's lands, trading off and on. There is usually a group in each village made up of men from ages 15 to 35, who are in charge of working in the fields and providing a huge festival during the dry season. To make farming and chores fun, local games to see how fast a man can hoe a field are held. Another society for men is the\nporo\n, or school for young men, usually located in the forest. For Senefo women, the greatest ability is the ability to cook well; if a woman or girl cannot, it is a shame to the family. The women's society,\nsandogo\n, is responsible mainly for divination.\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nWikimedia Commons has media related to\nCulture of Ivory Coast\n.\nLanguages of Ivory Coast\nSandobele\nKorhogo cloth\nIvorian cuisine\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nc\nByrnes, Rita M.

It is usually eaten with\nugali\nand\nkachumbari\n,\nmaharagwe\n(bean stew) and\nmchicha\n(shredded spinach).\tIt is served as a traditional meal during Christmas Day.\nAmong the\nLuhya\nresiding in the western region of the country,\ningokho\n(\nchicken\n) with\nugali\nis a favorite meal. Other than these, they also eat\ntsisaka\n,\nmiroo\n,\nmanagu\nand other dishes.\nIn the\nRift Valley\n, the\nKalenjin\nhave long made\nmursik\n, which they have with\nkimyet\n(\nugali\n) and vegetable relishes such as\nisageek\nand \"socheek\". Also among the\nKikuyu\nof Central Kenya, many\ntubers\n, including\nngwaci\n(\nsweet potatoes\n),\nnd\u0169ma\n(\ntaro root\n, known in Kenya as\narrowroot\n),\nikwa\n(\nyams\n), and\nmianga\n(\ncassava\n) are eaten, as well as legumes like\nbeans\nand a Kikuyu bean known as\nnjahi\n.\nAmong the\nLuo\nresiding on the western region around Lake Victoria,\nkuon\n(\nugali\n) and\nrech\n(fish) is a favourite, as well as\ngweno\n(chicken),\naliya\n\" (sun-dried meat),\nonyoso\n(type of ant),\nng'wen\n(termitoidae),\ndede\n(grasshoppers), various birds and green vegetables;\nalode\nsuch as\nosuga\n,\nakeyo\n,\nmuto\n,\ndodo\n,\ndek\n,\napoth\nand\nbo\n, are all consumed with\nugali\n.\nAs you travel around the country, distinct differences are noted based on what foods are locally available in each area. Grains are a staple food for groups that grow grains (e.g. Kikuyu, Embu, Meru, Kisii, etc.). Other communities such as the Luo and the Coastal community have\nfish\nand seafood for their staple food as these are available in such areas. In semi-arid areas like Turkana, foods made from sorghum are more common staple foods.\nAs you move towards the city, foods eaten by working families vary according to preference and ethnicity. Rice and stew are more common with working families, as are other dishes like\nchapati\n, which is a staple that originated from India (similar to the flatbread\nparatha\n), chicken stew, etc.\nNational dress\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\ndoes not\ncite\nany\nsources\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this section\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\n.

With more than 42 ethnic communities having their own traditional practices and symbols unique to them, this is a task that has proved elusive. However, several attempts have been made to design an outfit that can be worn as a national dress, much like the\nKente cloth\nof\nGhana\n.\nKitenge\nis a cotton fabric made into colours and design through\ntie-and-dye\nand heavy embroidery. It is commonly worn by a number of Kenya's populations. Though also worn in many other African countries, Kitenge is yet to be accepted in Kenya as an official dress as it is only worn during ceremonies and non-official functions. The Maasai wear dark red garments to symbolise their love for the earth and their dependence on it. It also stands for courage and blood that is given to them by nature.\nThe\nKanga\n(Khanga, Lesso) is another cloth that is commonly worn in practically every Kenyan home. The Kanga is a piece of clothing about 1.5 metres (4\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) by 1 metre (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in), screen printed with beautiful sayings in Swahili (or English) and is largely worn by women around the waist and torso.\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nMusic of Kenya\nA traditional Kenyan drum, similar to the\nDjembe\nof West Africa.\nKenyan dancers performing a traditional dance\nKenya is home to a diverse range of music styles, ranging from imported popular music,\nafro-fusion\nand\nbenga music\nto traditional\nfolk\nsongs. The guitar is the most popular instrument in Kenyan music, and songs often feature intricate guitar rhythms. The most famous guitarist of the early 20th century was Bonie Makie. Other notable musicians of the 60s era include\nFadhili Williams\n, recognised by many as the author of the hit song \"Malaika\" that was later re-done by\nMiriam Makeba\n,\nBoney M\nand\nDaudi Kabaka\n.\nPopular music in the 1980s and 1990s in Kenya could be divided into two genres: the Swahili sound and the Congolese sound. There are varying regional styles, and some performers create tourist-oriented \"hotel pop\" that is similar to western music.\nThem Mushrooms\n, later renamed Uyoga, was one of the popular groups in this era.\nIn the recent past, newer varieties of modern popular music have arisen which are mostly local derivatives of western hip-hop. Two subgenres have emerged: \"\nGenge\n\" and \"\nKapuka\n\" beats. This has revolutionised popular Kenyan music and created an industry dominated by the youth. There is also underground Kenyan hip hop that gets less radio play than Kapuka or Genge because it is less club oriented and more focussed on social commentary. Early pioneers include\nPoxi Presha\n,\nKalamashaka\n, and\nK-South\n. In Nairobi, hip-hop is viewed as more of a style than as a musical culture. There is a great correlation between the youth who listen to rap music and their economical status in the country with the majority of them coming from wealthy economic backgrounds. Since hip-hop is portrayed through clothing, magazines, and CDs, all of which are expensive, only the wealthier individuals are able to enjoy these luxuries.\n[\n5\n]\nMainstream artists include\nNameless\n,\nRedsan\n,\nNecessary Noize\n,\nNonini\n,\nJuacali\n,\nKleptomaniax\n,\nLongombas\n,\nSuzzanna Owiyo\n,\nAchieng Abura\n,\nEric Wainaina\nand others. Their sounds run the gamut from\nReggae\n/\nRagga\n, Pop, Afro-Fusion to Hip-Hop. Contemporary Kenyan music is becoming quite popular, with African-based music channels such as\nChannel O\nand\nMTV Base\n, giving them a greater audience(a hybrid of Kenyan languages and English/Swahili).\nThe\nKisima Music Awards\n, which recognise musical talent across East Africa, were founded and are currently based in Kenya. Every year numerous Kenyan artists take out categories in the scheme.\nThe\nAfrican Children's Choir\nfeatures children, many of whom are orphaned, from Kenya, as well as from other neighbouring African countries.\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nKenyan literature\nKenya National Theatre plays a significant role in Literature by providing platform to most of the local artists, particularly for spoken word and stage acting performances. Artists like \"Kennet B\" and his group at National Theatre have had great performances in High schools and in the local Radio and Television. A lot of wax painting and color printing done within villages like Kibra and Railway Museum significantly describe Kenyan literature.\nAdditionally, students in Kenyan High Schools have studied many \"set books\" from various Kenyan authors like Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Margaret Ogola, Meja Mwangi among others. Their works considerably explore the political, social-economic and contemporary themes in Kenya. \nOther places that one can experience the Kenyan creatives are Sarakasi Dome.\nArt\n[\nedit\n]\nAround\nLake Turkana\nexist ancient petroglyphs depicting human figures and animals.\nBantu tribes\nbuild funeral posts, where carvings of human heads atop geometric designs are still created.

Other films shot in Kenya in the recent past include the\nAcademy Award\nwinning\nNowhere in Africa\nand\nLara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life\n.\nSheena, Queen of the Jungle\nwon great acclaim in the 1980s and was one of the first foreign movies to be shot entirely on location in Kenya. Other highly acclaimed films set (and shot) in Kenya include\nKaren Blixen\n's\nOut of Africa\n, starring\nRobert Redford\nand\nMeryl Streep\nand directed by\nSydney Pollack\n, and\nBorn Free\n, an adaptation of the autobiography of\nJoy Adamson\n.

This\ngenre\nhas been around from the 1960s when actors like Mzee Pembe graced the Kenyan television screen. Others, like Benson Wanjau (Ojwang' Hatari) and Mary Khavere (Mama Kayai), followed later with their comedies presented exclusively in\nSwahili\n, reaching millions of households courtesy of\nKenya Broadcasting Corporation\ntelevision station.\nSerious Television drama was witnessed for the first time in the early 1990s with the entry of popular actors like\nPackson Ngugi\n,\nBMJ\nMuriithi alias\nBen Mutua Jonathan Muriithi\nand Betty Achieng', alongside other thespians who featured in a variety of TV shows following the\nliberalisation\nof the\nairwaves\nby the Kenyan government.

The new style was later to be perfected by the group, 'Redykyulass', a trio of young Kenyans \u2013 Walter Mong'are, Tony Njuguna and John Kiare (KJ) \u2013 who specialized in political satire. They lampooned not only the establishment but also\nDaniel arap Moi\n, the Kenyan President at the time.\n[\n7\n]\nThe lampooning of the Kenyan head of state was unprecedented and could have easily led to their prosecution, or even detention without trial, had it been done in the 1980s, when mimicking the head of state and exhibiting any form of political dissent was considered treason.\nOther Stations known to promote theatre in Kenya include Nation TV, Kenya Television Network (KTN) a Citizen TV, all based in the nation's capital,\nNairobi\n. K24, the newest TV station to enter the scene, started its test run in Nairobi in December 2007. It captured the interest of many mainly because of the introduction of\nJeff Koinange\n, one of the most popular Kenyan journalists who has worked for major international media houses like\nCNN\n, as its chief News anchor.\nA satellite- and Internet-based 24-hour pan-African TV channel,\nA24\n, was scheduled to start broadcasting from Nairobi in 2008.

Though various start-up companies have appeared in the country since 2007, the existing businesses are dealing with funding issues and few successes have been made. However, shared spaces, support programs and government grants introduced over the past few years have allowed the industry to grow large in a short period of time.

Bassa\nalphabet\nwas popularized by Dr. Thomas Narvin Lewis in the early 20th century, after attending studies in the U.S at\nSyracuse University\n. He modeled it after he came into contact with former slaves of Bassa origin in Brazil and the West Indies who were still using the alphabet.

The major radio stations in Liberia are UNMIL Radio, Radio ELWA, Truth Radio, ELBC Radio, and\nSTAR radio\n. All have programs available to listen to online. There are currently no AM radio stations (which existed before the war) but there are a few shortwave stations. Radio also serves to promote peace, reconciliation and connect the country both rural and urban Liberians through community based apprenticeship programs for youths and young adults.\nA famous news\nblackboard\nin Monrovia is\nThe Daily Talk\n.\nThe Daily Talk\nis accessible for free.\n[\n13\n]\nAccording to\nThe New York Times\n, the blackboard is \"the most widely read report\" in Monrovia, as many Monrovians lack the money or the electricity necessary for access to the conventional\nmass media\n.\n[\n13\n]\nThe most widely read newspapers include the\nLiberia Herald\n,\nThe Analyst\n,\nLiberian Observer\n,\nThe News\n,\nThe Heritage\n, and\nThe Inquirer\n, among others. Several Liberian journalists have been awarded national and international awards and acclaim around the world for their commitment to\npress freedom\nand promotion of Democracy in\npost war\ncountries and regions.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe arts\n[\nedit\n]\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Liberia\nLiberia has its own ancient music and instruments. While Liberian music is part of wider\nWest African\nmusic heritage, it is also distinct from its neighbors. There are several different types of drums used in traditional music.\nDrums\nare among the most widely used instruments in ceremonies both official and nonofficial, weddings, christenings, naming ceremonies, holidays, graduations, etc. Next to drums, beaded\ngourd\nrattles called Saasaa are also used in mainstream music by many Liberian singers, musicians, and\nensembles\nacross the country.\nSongs are sung in both English and all indigenous languages. Other instruments similar to the\nxylophone\ninclude Yomo Gor. Music is a main highlight of Liberian culture not only used as entertainment but to educate society on issues ranging from culture, politics, history to human rights.\nReligious music\nis also popular.\nChristian music\nis heavily influenced by its counterpart in the United States, regardless of region. Islamic\nnasheeds\npopular in many countries with Muslim communities are almost unheard of in Liberia. Instead, music for Liberian Muslims is based on\nQuranic\ncitations, adhan and music related to everyday life called suku. Aside from religious and traditional music,\nrap\nand Highlife are widely popular genres, especially with younger Liberians and American music aficionados, and can be heard in discoth\u00e8ques, parties, clubs and on radios throughout the country. Jazz, funk, soul, rap and a new music style or Liberian rap called\nHipco\ncombining rap, R&B, traditional rhymes, and joint Liberian and American influences are part of the wider music of Liberia.\nCrafts\n[\nedit\n]\nLiberian ceremonial spoon\nLiberia is renowned for its detailed decorative and ornate masks, large and miniature\nwood carvings\nof realistic human faces, famous people, scenes of everyday life, and accessories particularly combs, spoons, and forks which are often enlarged sculptures. Sculptures are produced in both the countryside and cities. Liberian wood curved sculptures are heavily influenced by ancient history predating modern Liberia, folklore, proverbs, spirituality, rural life and show the artist's strong observations for grand detail and their connections to the people and objects sculpted. Liberian artists both in the country and\ndiaspora\nhave also gained recognition for various styles of paintings in abstract, perspective, and\ngraphic art\n.\nDue to its strong relationship with the United States, Liberia has also produced its own American-influenced quilts. The American free people of color and former slaves who emigrated to Liberia brought with them their sewing and quilting skills and was originally done by\nAmerico-Liberians\nbeginning in the 19th century.\nQueen Victoria\ninvited\nMartha Ann Ricks\n, on behalf of Liberian Ambassador\nEdward Wilmot Blyden\n, to\nWindsor Castle\non 16\u00a0July 1892.\n[\n14\n]\nRicks, a former slave from\nTennessee\n, had saved for more than fifty years, to afford the voyage from Liberia to England to personally thank the Queen for the\nBritish navy's\nactions against the slave trade. Ricks shook hands with the Queen and presented her with a Coffee Tree quilt, which Victoria later sent to the 1893\nWorld's Columbian Exposition\nfor display. A mystery remains as to where the quilt is today.\n[\n14\n]\nThe census of 1843 indicated a variety of occupations, including hatter, milliner, seamstress, and tailor.\n[\n15\n]\nLiberia hosted National Fairs in 1857 and 1858 in which prizes were awarded for various needle arts. However, today, Liberians from all ethnic groups make quilts, although quilting is not as popular as it once was when the country was adapting American customs, culture, and lifestyle in the mid-19th century. In modern times, Liberian presidents would present quilts as official government gifts, and when current Liberian President\nEllen Johnson Sirleaf\nmoved into the Executive Mansion, she reportedly had a Liberian-made quilt installed in her presidential office.\n[\n16\n]\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nA literary tradition has existed in Liberia for over a century. Liberia had no written tradition until the 19th century. Numerous Liberian authors throughout the years have contributed to the writings of various genres. They have written on\nfolk art\n, ancient proverbs, everyday life in countryside, city life, religion and observation of their own lives. Culture, tradition, identity, society, taboo subjects, human rights, equality and diversity within Liberia, multiculturalism,\nPan-Africanism\n,\ncolonialism\nand its reverberating consequences today, post-colonial African countries and future of the country have been featured in novels, books, magazines, and novelettes since the 19th century. The first novel by an African published in English was written by a Liberian,\nJoseph Jeffrey Walters\n, a Vai convert to Christianity studying at\nOberlin College\nin the United States. The book titled\nGuanya Pau: A Story of an African Princess\nwas published in 1891 by Lauer and Mattil of Cleveland, Ohio, and deals with the issue of child marriage and women's rights.\n[\n17\n]\nPoetry is a prominent canon of Liberian literature. Many authors have presented their pose in all poetic styles. Often adding their own unique perspectives, writing styles and observation of the material and spiritual worlds into their books. Liberia's prominent writers also share a variety of genres that cross several decades.\nEdward Wilmot Blyden\nIn the 19th century,\nEdward Wilmot Blyden\nwas the most renowned Liberian author. A diplomat, educator, statesman and writer, Blyden was considered one of the early fathers of Pan Africanism along with\nW. E. B. Du Bois\nand\nMarcus Garvey\n. His writings revolved around the need for Africans to develop their own identity, be culturally, spiritually and politically aware of their own potential and preside over their own self-rule and to disprove the European view of Africans as culture-less. These writings inspired many Liberian authors in later years and still do today. A national hero in Liberia, Blyden is known in world history and on the African continent as the genius behind the phrase \"Africa for Africans!\" and later inspired Marcus Garvey's\nBack to Africa\nMovement.\nDuring the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century, other authors have taken a less political but prominent role in Liberian literature. Several authors are renowned for their detailed and deep observation of Liberian life both in the country and abroad in the Diaspora in Europe or United States. Authors\nBai T. Moore\n,\nE. G. Bailey\n,\nRoland T. Dempster\n,\nWilton G. S. Sankawulo\n, have all reflected on Liberian culture, tradition, modernization and the pain of exile, loneliness, loss and remembrance in fiction, and non-fiction works.\nBai T. Moore's novella\nMurder in the Cassava Patch\nis required reading for many Liberian high-school students. Published in 1968, the book is based on the true story of a murder, and explores the most taboo subjects in mid-20th-century Liberia as the story reveals the lives of the main characters and their hometown. E. G. Bailey is a\nspoken-word\nartist, theatre and radio producer.\nPolitician and author Wilton G. S. Sankawulo published many collections of poems and stories that later became praised anthologies on Liberian folklore and wider African literary tradition, entitled\nMore Modern African Stories\n. His most celebrated book is\nSundown at Dawn: A Liberian Odyssey\n. According to the book's publisher, Dusty Spark Publishing, it is regarded as \"one of the literary achievements of postwar Liberia and contemporary Africa.\"\n[\n18\n]\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLiberian cuisine\nLiberian cuisine has\nrice\nas its staple.

    "Libya": "Flag of Libya\nA Libyan traditional music band\nLibyan culture\nis a blend of many influences, due to its exposure to many historical eras.\nLibya\nwas an Italian colony for over four decades, which also had a great impact on the country's culture. Once an isolated society, Libyans succeeded in preserving their traditional folk customs alive today, now recognized by many as the most \"pure\" extant form of\nArab culture\nfound outside the\nArabian Peninsula\n. Libyan culture places strong emphasis on family, tribal bonds, loyalty, solidarity and faithfulness.\n[\n1\n]\nThe majority of Libyans are\nArab\n, and 96.6% are\nSunni Muslims\n. The predominantly spoken language in Libya is\nArabic\n. Italian and English are spoken in a minor level and in tourist areas. 95% of the country is desert and 90% of the Libyan population inhabit the coastline region as a result.\n[\n2\n]\nFlag\n[\nedit\n]\nIn February 2011, when the Libyan revolution took place, the national Transition Council reintroduced the old flag used by the kingdom prior to Gaddafi\u2019s military coup in 1969.\n[\n3\n]\nThe flag consists of three colors: red, black and green, which represent the three major regions of the country, red for\nFezzan\n, Black for\nCyrenaica\nand green for\nTripolitania\n; the crescent and star represent the main religion of Libya,\nIslam\n.\nVisual art\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of Libyan artists\nThe Libyan civil war of 2011 sparked an awakening in the country's artistic development, inspiring a new generation of artists to use the medium of art to share their thoughts on Libyan politics, history, culture, and contemporary affairs.\nContemporary Libyan artists, including Suhaib Tantoush, Mohammed Basheer,\nShefa Salem\n, and Abdullah Hadia. Due to their nation's ongoing development, Suhaib Tantoush is an example of Libyan art that speaks to the struggles that its people endure. This may be observed in his caricature, where he captures the day-to-day hardships of Libyans\u2014such as long waiting lines, blackouts, and post-conflict crises\u2014and so recalls the national struggle. The history and legacy of Libya are also depicted in art, as demonstrated by Shefa Salem in a Murel, who blended modern Libyan characters with Greek ancestry to represent Libya's legacy.\n[\n4\n]\nIn Libya, artistic expression has existed for thousands of years.The Tadrart Acacus mountain range in Libya is renowned and recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to the thousands of cave paintings and carvings that date back 14,000 years. These caverns, which span the Sahara Desert, have animal engravings and depict scenes from times when the desert was habitable.\n[\n5\n]\nThe Central Sanaran rock art located in southwest Libya on the Messak plateau. The Pastoral style of rock art are characterized by expressive outline paintings of cattle.\n[1]\nPrior to the war, Libyan art was also well-known. Prominent artists from the country included Mohamed Zwawi(1936 - 5 June 2011), a pioneer of Libyan cartoons whose lighthearted depictions of daily life have featured in publications like at-Tawra and Al Amal. The Arab world has given the artist a lot of praise.\n[2]\nThis section is empty.\nYou can help by\nadding to it\n.\n(\nMay 2023\n)\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLibyan literature\nLibyan literature has its roots in\nantiquity\n, but contemporary writing from\nLibya\ndraws on a variety of influences.\nLibyan poet\nKhaled Mattawa\nremarks:\n\"Against claims that Libya has a limited body of literature, classicists may be quick to note that ancient Greek lyric poet\nCallimachus\nand the exquisite prose stylist\nSinesius\nwere Libyan. But students of\nLibyan history\nand literature will note that a vast time gap between those ancient luminaries and the writers of today. [...] Libya has historically made a limited contribution to\nArabian literature\n\"\n.\nThe\nArab Renaissance\n(\nAl-Nahda\n) of the late 19th and early 20th centuries did not reach Libya as early as other Arab lands, and Libyans contributed little to its initial development. However, Libya at this time developed its own literary tradition, centred on\noral poetry\n, much of which expressed the suffering brought about by the\nItalian colonial period\n.\nLibyan literature began to bloom in the late 1960s, with the writings of\nSadeq al-Neihum\n,\nKhalifa al-Fakhri\n,\nKhamel al-Maghur\n(\nprose\n),\nMuhammad al-Shaltami\n, and\nAli al-Regeie\n(\npoetry\n). Many Libyan writers of the 1960s adhered to\nnationalist\n,\nsocialist\n, and generally\nprogressive\nviews.\nIn 1969, a\nmilitary coup\nbrought\nMuammar al-Gaddafi\nto power. In the mid-1970s, the new government set up a single publishing house, and authors were required to write in support of the authorities. Those who refused were imprisoned, emigrated, or ceased writing. Censorship laws were loosened, but not abolished in the early 1990s, resulting in a literary renewal. Some measure of dissent began to be expressed in Libyan literature, but books remained censored and self-censored to a significant extent.\nWith the overthrow of Gaddafi's government in the\nLibyan Civil War\n, literary censorship was abolished, and Article 14 of the\ninterim constitution\nguarantees \"liberty of the press, publication and mass media\". Contemporary Libyan literature is influenced by \"local lore, North African and Eastern Mediterranean Arabian literatures, and world literature at large\" (K. Mattawa). \u00c9migr\u00e9 writers have also contributed significantly to Libyan literature, and include\nIbrahim Al-Kouni\n,\nAhmad Al-Faqih\n, and\nSadeq al-Neihum\n.\n[\n6\n]\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLibyan cuisine\nAsida\nis Libya's traditional breakfast. It consists of a cooked\nwheat flour\nlump of dough, sometimes with added\nbutter\n,\nhoney\n, or date syrup.\nLibyan dishes borrow from the Arabic, Mediterranean and Italian cultures that met in the area.\n[\n3\n]\nOlives, palm oil, dates, unleavened bread, and stuffed sweet peppers appear frequently in meals. Libyans do not consume any type of pork and all meats must be halal (killed humanely and prayed over according to Muslim customs). Attention to detail in Libyan cooking is very important; in fact, many spices are used in all the dishes and they need to be put in by the right amounts to enrich the taste. The Libyan diet is rich with seafood and includes a diversity of vegetables and cereals. Olive oil is the main ingredient of nearly every meal.\nMeals are of great symbolic importance in the Libyan culture and the biggest meal of the day is lunch. Shops and businesses close for a couple of hours in the afternoon to allow families to gather together and eat.\n[\n3\n]\nThere are four main ingredients of traditional Libyan food: olives, palm dates, grains, and milk.\n[\n7\n]\nMeals usually end with fruit or melon (Libya is known to have excellent fruit crops). People also drink green tea after meals to help aid digestion. Libyans love tea and coffee, and families usually gather together for their afternoon tea/coffee and catch up on the daily gossip. Libyan tea is known to have thick consistency. The Libyan tea is very strong and thick, kind of like syrup. To follow tradition, the tea is usually first poured into a mug and then into another then back to the original mug, back and forth for a few minutes then poured from a high distance to the glass to form \u2018reghwa\u2019 or foam.\n[\n7\n]\nLibyan soup is a very famous dish throughout Libya and is often presented as a starter. It is considered to be an important dish in Ramadan, where people usually break their fast with soup (after having a glass of milk and a couple of dates). It is a thick highly spiced soup, known simply as\nShba Arabiya\n, or \"Arabian soup\". It contains many of the ingredients from many other Libyan dishes, including onions, tomatoes, meat (chicken or lamb), chili peppers, cayenne pepper, saffron, chickpeas, mint, cilantro, and parsley.\n[\n8\n]\nBazeen or Bazin is also a very recognizable Libyan food.\n[\n9\n]\nIt is made of a mixture of barley flour, with a little plain flour.\n[\n10\n]\nThe flour is boiled in salted water to make a hard dough, then is kneaded into a semi-spherical ball and placed in the middle of a large bowl (women sit on the floor and hold the pan between their legs while using a wooden ladle to mix and kneed the dough to its solid and thick consistency), around which the sauce is poured. The sauce around the dough is made by frying chopped onions with lamb meat, adding turmeric, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, fenugreek, sweet paprika, and tomato paste. Potatoes can also be added. Finally, eggs are boiled and arranged around the dome. The dish is then served with a well-known Libyan salad/complement of pickled carrots, cucumber and chili peppers, known as\namasyar\n.\n[\n7\n]\nAnother type of Bazin is called \u2018Aish\u2019 or \u2018Aseeda\u2019 which basically follows the same concept of the Bazzin except it is made with pure white flour, has a smoother and softer texture and is eaten sweet by adding honey, syrup or on some occasions powdered sugar. Aish is normally eaten as breakfast or on special occasions, like when a baby is born or \u2018Maylood\u2019, (Mohammed\u2019s birth date).\nOne of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine, which is also a Libyan specialty, since it is not found anywhere else, is\nbatata mubattana\n(filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\nSome other popular dishes in Libya include a diversity of pasta, which are one of Italy\u2019s lasting influences and couscous, which is widely popular across the North African region.\nAll alcohol is banned in Libya, in accordance with\nSharia\n, the religious laws of Islam. Bottled mineral water is widely consumed, as well as various soft drinks, such as the Coca-Cola.\nLibyan traditional dress\n[\nedit\n]\nNowadays, in modern Libya, people no longer wear the traditional dress very often, especially women, except the elderly Libyans, who still comply with traditions. The normal dress includes international modernized fashion that has spread out from the Western World. Women in Libya dress modestly and most of them wear the Hijab.\nThe traditional dress is now limited to special occasions; men wear it more often. In fact, it is popularly worn for Friday prayers, Eid (Islamic holiday) and weddings. Although the outfit slightly differs from one area to another, Libyan men\u2019s clothes tend to be similar across entire Libya. It consists of a long white shirt \u2018Jalabiya\u2019or \u2018Qamis\u2019, long trousers \u2018Sirwal\u2019 and a vest called \u2018Sadriya\u2019 that is usually heavily knit with black silk and has buttons on its front. Men also wear a headdress called a \u2018Shashiyah\u2019 that is usually red or black. Men in Tripolitania prefer wearing the black Shashiyah while the men in Cyrenaica wear both. Libyan men also wear a tight, knitted, white cap underneath the Shashiyah for when they are indoors. A large outer cloak known as \u2018Jarid\u2019 is worn on top and wrapped around the body in a Roman-toga way, except in Libya, the Jarid is usually tied at the right shoulder and the remainder is brought around up over the head. Libyan men wear leather boots, usually with a heel for riding horses, leather sandals or slippers.\n[\n11\n]\nAs for Libyan women, the traditional outfit differs slightly from one region to another; however, the general outfit consists of a blouse with baggy sleeves that are embroidered with beads and silver/gold thread and baggy silk trousers that have an elastic band at the bottom. On top of that, women wear brightly colored cloths are made into dresses like togas and held together by silver brooches. Women in the rural areas use heavy woven rug-like cloths due to the climate. The head is covered using a colorful cloth embellished with colorful pom-poms. Libyan women wear large pieces of gold or silver jewelry. The neckwear usually goes down to the knees and the bracelets are 4\u20136 inches wide. The large silver brooches used to attach the cloth are now replaced with gold and are usually decorated with a \u201cKhamaisah\u201d, a hand shaped symbol, or other charms that are believed to keep the evil eye off.\n[\n11\n]\nWomen only wear the full outfit with the jewelry in special occasions and weddings. It is traditional for the groom to give the outfit with the gold to his bride at their wedding and for the bride to wear it the day after. The women\u2019s traditional outfit is very expensive, but the prices vary depending on the quality and weight of gold or silver.\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Libya\nIn Libyan culture, however, music is specific to a city or region. Among the Berber or Amazigh populations in the south of the country, the most widely-liked music is the distinctive folk music of the Tuareg peoples. Sung in their original Temasek dialect.\n[\n12\n]\nThe tinde drum and a imzad, which are only performed by women, are the instruments utilized.\nIn Libya, women play a significant part in music. Traditional bands are groups of women that perform at gatherings and weddings specifically for women. They sing rhyming lines that vividly and frequently depict Libyan culture and heritage.\nLibyan musician Dania Ben Sassi gained rapid attention in 2011 and 2013 for producing and developing Amazigh music that honors the Amazigh people's resistance and features her Tamazight singing. Specific recordings of music in the Tamazight language became quite popular among western Libyans during and after the 2011 revolution, and seen through networks that extended into Tunisia and the larger Maghreb area.\n[3]\nThe word \"Zimzamat\" in Libya refers to a live band; these bands are typically made up of female musicians and are played at parties, weddings, and even everyday events. Remarkably, zimzamat is also present in the most opulent event spaces in Tripoli. Wedding halls frequently have two stages: one for the live band and one for the bride and groom. When it comes to music, they are customarily cheerful, enjoyable, and meet social expectations.\n[4]\nThroughout the 42-year dictatorship of Muammar Gaddafi, western music was outlawed in Libya, and non-Arabic instruments were burned in public places all around the country. As a result, radio broadcasts and television would not play non-Arabic music. In contrast, Libyan music was widely revered and played as part of the country's customs. At the 2011 Libyan Revolution, the people of Libya then rebelled against Gaddafi banning of western music.\n[\n13\n]\nMedia\n[\nedit\n]\nGovernment control over the media has resulted in much of the population preferring to entertain itself by watching videos or foreign stations via satellite. Libyan television programmes are mostly in Arabic with a 30-minute news broadcast each evening in English and French. It is also possible to watch the occasional sports programs. However, the majority of programming is cultural and thus showcases more traditional Libyan music and entertainment.\nLibya's daily newspaper is Al-Fajr al-Jadid and is published in\nTripoli\n. Foreign newspapers are available, but are often very out-of-date by the time they reach the shops.\nTribal and political divide\n[\nedit\n]\nThe tribal system has been a persistent aspect of Libyan society throughout history. From before the Roman era, coastal Libya was separated into two separate provinces: Tripolitania in the west, centered around Tripoli, and Cyrenaica in the east, centered on Benghazi. Libya appears to have been split along the classic east-west lines once more as a result of the 2011 civil war. The largest tribes include the\nWarfalla\n,\nZuwayyah\n,\nQadhadhfa\n, and\nMagarha\n.\n[\n14\n]\ntwo administrations have been fighting for\u00a0 political control in Libya: one is headquartered in Tripoli (west) and is led by\nAbdul Hamid Dbeibeh\n, while the other is in the east and is backed by\u00a0Marshal\nKhalifa Haftar\n.\n[\n15\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nHarris, Lillian Craig (2022-02-06).\nLibya: Qadhafi's Revolution and the Modern State\n.

The influence of\nArabs\n, Indians, British, French and Chinese settlers is also evident.\nThe most emblematic musical instrument of\nMadagascar\n, the\nvaliha\n, is a\nbamboo\ntube zither\ncarried to the island by early settlers from\nsouthern Borneo\n, and is very similar in form to those found in\nIndonesia\nand the\nPhilippines\ntoday.\n[\n1\n]\nTraditional\nhouses in Madagascar\nare likewise similar to those of southern\nBorneo\nin terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar.\n[\n2\n]\nReflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living.\n[\n3\n]\nThe production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven\nlamba\n, has evolved into a varied and refined art.\n[\n4\n]\nThe Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in\nMalagasy cuisine\n, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.\n[\n5\n]\nAfrican influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland.\nCattle rustling\n, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.\n[\n6\n]\nWorldview and religions\n[\nedit\n]\nReligion in Madagascar (2020) according to the\nPew Research Center\n[\n7\n]\nChristian\n(85.4%)\nFolk religions\n(4.6%)\nMuslim\n(3%)\nUnaffiliated/Other (7%)\nTraditional worldview\n[\nedit\n]\nMahafaly tomb with traditional painted decoration\n4.6% of the Island's population is solely adherent to the traditional religion of\nFomba-gasy\n,\n[\n8\n]\nwhich tends to emphasize links between the living and the\nrazana\n(ancestors). The\nveneration of ancestors\nhas led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the\nfamadihana\n, whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere.\n[\n9\n]\nAcross the island, many Malagasy make offerings out of respect to the ancestors, such as by pouring the first cap-full of each newly opened bottle of rum into the northeastern corner of the room.\n[\n10\n]\nConsideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to\nfady\n, taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called\nZanahary\nor Andriamanitra.\n[\n11\n]\nSocial structure and values\n[\nedit\n]\nEach of the many ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize\nfihavanana\n(solidarity),\nvintana\n(destiny),\ntody\n(karma), and\nhasina\n, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nAlthough social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity and roles within the community.\n[\n13\n]\nMalagasy people traditionally consult\nMpanandro\n(\"Makers of the Days\") to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or\nfamadihana\n, according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the\nombiasy\n(from\nolona-be-hasina\n, \"man of much virtue\") of the southeastern\nAntemoro\nethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Somali settlers.\n[\n14\n]\nIntroduced religions\n[\nedit\n]\nMajority of the Malagasy population adheres to\nChristianity\n, with practitioners of\nProtestantism\nslightly outnumbering adherents to\nRoman Catholicism\n.\n[\n15\n]\nToday, most Malagasy Christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones related to honoring their ancestors. For instance, they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a\nChristian minister\nto consecrate a\nfamadihana\nreburial.\n[\n9\n]\nMany Malagasy believe they are descended from ancient Israelites and refer to a\nMalagasy Jewish\ndiaspora (Diaspora Jiosy Gasy), with asserted signs such as dietary, menstrual, and life-cycle practices. In 2011, a normative Jewish movement was started and soon recognized by the government.\n[\n16\n]\nIslam is practiced by around 7% of the population, with practitioners largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of\nMahajanga\nand\nAntsiranana\n. The vast majority of\nMuslims\nare\nSunni\nand are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity,\nIndians\n,\nPakistanis\nand\nComorians\n. More recently,\nHinduism\nwas introduced to Madagascar through\nGujarati people\nimmigrating from the\nSaurashtra\nregion of\nIndia\nin the late 19th century.\n[\n17\n]\nPerception of time\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Malagasy people of Madagascar see time in a cyclical manner. They imagine the future as flowing into the back of their heads, or passing them from behind, then becoming the past as it stretches out in front of them. The past is in front of their eyes because it is visible, known and influential. They can look at it, enjoy it, learn from it, even \"play\" with it.\n[\n18\n]\nIn his 1915 book\nA naturalist in Madagascar\n, naturalist\nJames Sibree\npublished the following table of Malagasy terms used to refer to times of day and night:\n[\n19\n]\nMalagasy term\nEnglish translation\nTime of day (approximate)\nMamaton\u2019 alina\nCentre of night\n12:00 AM; midnight\nMisasaka alina\nHalving of night\nManeno sahona\nFrog croaking\n2:00 AM\nManeno akoho\nCock-crowing\n3:00 AM\nMaraina alina koa\nMorning also night\n4:00 AM\nManeno goaika\nCrow croaking\n5:00 AM\nManga vodilanitra\nBright horizon\n5:15 AM\nMangoan\u2019 atsinanana\nReddish East\nMangiran-dratsy\nGlimmer of day\nAhitan-tsoratr\u2019 omby\nColors of cattle can be seen\n5:30 AM\nMazava ratsy\nDusk\nMifoha lo-maozoto\nDiligent people awake\nMaraina koa\nEarly morning\nVaky masoandro\nSunrise\n6:00 AM\nVaky andro\nDaybreak\nPiakandro\nAntoandro be nanahary\nBroad daylight\nEfa bana ny andro\nMihintsana ando\nDew-falls\n6:15 AM\nMivoaka omby\nCattle go out (to pasture)\nMaim-bohon-dravina\nLeaves are dry (from dew)\n6:30 AM\nAfa-dranom-panala\n[\na\n]\nHoar-frost disappears\n6:45 AM\nManara vava nya ndro\n[\nb\n]\nThe day chills the mouth\nMisandratra andro\nAdvance of the day\n8:00 AM\nMitatao haratra\nOver (at a right angle with) the purlin\n9:00 AM\nMitatao vovonana\nOver the ridge of the roof\n12:00 PM; noon\nMandray tokonana ny andro\nDay taking hold of the threshold\n12:30 PM\nMitsidika andro\nPeeping-in of the day\n1:00 PM\nLatsaka iray dia ny andro\nDay less one step\nSolafak\u2019 andro\nSlipping of the day\n1:30 PM \u2013 2:00 PM\n2:00 PM\nTafalatsaka ny andro\nDecline of the day\nMihilana ny andro\nAm-pitotoam-bary\nAt the rice-pounding place\nMby amin\u2019 ny andry ny andro\nAt the house post\nAm-pamatoran-janak\u2019 omby\nAt the place of tying the calf\n3:00 PM\nMby am-pisoko ny andro\nAt the sheep or poultry pen\n4:00 PM\nMody omby tera-bao\nThe cow newly calved comes home\n4:30\nTafapaka ny andro\nSun touching (\ni.e.\nthe eastern wall)\n5:00\nMody omby\nCattle come home\n5:30\nMena masoandro\nSunset flush\n5:45\nMaty masoandro\nSunset (\nlit.\n\"Sun dead\")\n6:00\nMiditra akoho\nFowls come in\n6:15\nSomambisamby\nDusk; twilight\n6:30\nMaizim-bava-vilany\nEdge of rice-cooking pan obscure\n6:45\nManokom-bary olona\nPeople begin to cook rice\n7:00\nHoman-bary olona\nPeople eat rice\n8:00\nTapi-mihinana\nFinished eating\n8:30\nMandry olona\nPeople go to sleep\n9:00\nTapi-mandry olona\nEveryone in bed\n9:30\nMipoa-tafondro\nGun-fire\n10:00\nLanguage\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nMalagasy language\nand\nLanguages of Madagascar\nThe Malagasy language is of\nMalayo-Polynesian\norigin and is generally spoken throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally mutually intelligible,\n[\n20\n]\ncan be clustered under one of two sub-groups: eastern Malagasy, spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of Antananarivo; and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains. French became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is a\nfrancophone\ncountry, and French is mostly spoken as a second language among the educated population and used for international communication.\n[\n12\n]\nArt\n[\nedit\n]\nVisual arts\n[\nedit\n]\nMalagasy girl in\nNosy Be\nwearing\nmasonjoany\n, an endemic decorative and protective paste made from ground wood\nTraditional arts are based on the creative use of local and natural materials. The tradition of silk weaving and\nlamba\nproduction exemplifies this form of art. The weaving of\nraffia\nand other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats.\n[\n21\n]\nWood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods,\naloalo\nfunerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market.\n[\n22\n]\nThe decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the\nZafimaniry\npeople of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's\nlist of Intangible Cultural Heritage\nin 2008.\n[\n23\n]\nAmong the\nAntaimoro\npeople, the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists.\n[\n22\n]\nEmbroidery\nand\ndrawn thread work\nare done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets.\n[\n21\n]\nA small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar.\n[\n24\n]\nPerforming arts\n[\nedit\n]\nTheater and dance are strong traditions on the island. A traditional form of theater emerged in the form of the\nhiragasy\n, a day-long spectacle of music, song, dance and oration performed by a troupe (typically related by blood or marriage and of rural origin) or as a competition between two troupes. The tradition in its contemporary form began in the late 18th century when Merina prince\nAndrianampoinimerina\nfirst used musicians to draw a crowd for his political speeches. These troupes became independent, and began to incorporate political commentary and critique in their performances. The audience plays an active role at hiragasy events, expressing their satisfaction with the talent of the troupe members and the message they proclaim through applause, cheers or sounds of disapproval.\n[\n25\n]\nThe troupe Tarika Ramilison Fenoarivo led by\nRamilison Besigara\nis considered the most popular and influential hira gasy troupe of the last four decades.\n[\n26\n]\nWestern theater was introduced with\nFrench colonization\nin 1896, producing a new form of Malagasy theater that incorporated a series of short musical and dance performances set to songs accompanied by piano or guitar played in the style of traditional valiha culture songs. The compositions of this period by pianist theatrical composers like\nAndrianary Ratianarivo\n(1895\u20131949) and\nNaka Rabemananatsoa\n(1892\u20131952) form part of the canon of classical Malagasy music and feature in the repertoire of Malagasy students of piano.\n[\n27\n]\nThe dances accompanying theatrical performances represent only a fraction of the myriad diverse dance styles found across the island. Dance remains a living art and new styles are continually emerging. Many have lent their name to the style of music to which they are danced. In the 19th century royal court, the\nquadrille\nwas danced to Malagasy-influenced piano tunes; the last of these Malagasy quadrilles, called the\nAfindrafindrao\n, was composed shortly before colonization and accompanies a specific partner dance. The tune and the dance were revived upon national independence as a distinctly Malagasy tradition now commonly performed to commence festivities such as weddings and concerts.\nA wide range of performance traditions have developed in Madagascar. One of the island's foremost artistic traditions is its\noratory\n, as expressed in the forms of\nhainteny\n(poetry),\nkabary\n(public discourse) and\nohabolana\n(proverbs).\n[\n28\n]\n[\n29\n]\nAn epic poem exemplifying these traditions, the\nIbonia\n, has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities.\n[\n30\n]\nElements of oral history and traditional oratory were documented by British and French visitors to the island. The first Malagasy historian was Raombana (1809\u20131855), one of the first pupils of the\nLondon Missionary Society\nschool at the\nRova of Antananarivo\n, who documented early 19th century Merina history in English and Malagasy. The\nTantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara\n, a compilation of the oral history of the Merina sovereigns, forms another major source of knowledge about traditional highland society and was collected and published in the late 19th century by a Catholic priest residing in the highlands. Western literary arts developed in the early 20th century under French colonization.\nLiterary arts\n[\nedit\n]\nAntandroy\ndancers\nMain article:\nLiterature of Madagascar\nThe first African modern poet, a Merina named\nJean-Joseph Rabearivelo\n(1901 or 1903\u20131937), gained celebrity for blending surrealist, romantic and modernist poetic forms with elements of traditional Malagasy oratory, as well as for his suicide by cyanide in 1937. Rabearivelo was also among the first in Madagascar to publish historical novels and wrote Madagascar's only Western-style opera.\n[\n31\n]\nThis blending of Western and traditional influence in the literary arts was carried on by such artists as\nElie Rajaonarison\n, an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.\n[\n32\n]\nOther notable poets include\nJacques Rabemananjara\n, Pierre Randrianarisoa, Georges Andriamanantena (Rado),\nJean Verdi Salomon Razakandraina (Dox)\nand others. Leading authors include\nJean-Luc Raharimanana\n,\nMich\u00e8le Rakotoson\n,\nClarisse Ratsifandrihamanana\n, David Jaomanoro, Solofo Randrianja, Emilson Daniel Andriamalala and Celestin Andriamanantena. A number of comic books have also been created by Malagasy authors such as Anselme Razafindrainibe (1956\u20132011).\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Madagascar\nValiha orchestra at the\nParis World Exposition\nof 1931\nMadagascar has also developed a rich\nmusical heritage\n, embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal\nsalegy\nor highland\nhiragasy\nthat enliven village gatherings, local dance floors and national airwaves.\n[\n33\n]\nMalagasy music has been shaped by the musical traditions of\nSoutheast Asia\n,\nAfrica\n,\nOceania\n,\nArabia\n, England, France and the United States as successive waves of settlers have made the island their home.\n[\n34\n]\nTraditional instruments reflect these widespread origins: the\nmandoliny\nand\nkabosy\nowe their existence to the introduction of the\nguitar\nby early\nArab\nor\nEuropean\nseafarers, the ubiquitous\ndjembe\noriginated in mainland\nAfrica\nand the\nvaliha\n\u2014the\nbamboo\ntube zither\nconsidered the national instrument of\nMadagascar\n\u2014directly evolved from an earlier form of zither carried with the first\nAustronesian\nsettlers on their\noutrigger canoes\n.\n[\n1\n]\nMalagasy music can be roughly divided into three categories: traditional, contemporary and popular music. Traditional musical styles vary by region and reflect local ethnographic history. For instance, in the\nHighlands\n, the valiha and more subdued vocal styles are emblematic of the\nMerina\n, the predominantly Austronesian ethnic group that has inhabited the area since at least the 15th century, whereas among the southern\nBara people\n, who trace their ancestry back to the African mainland, their\na cappella\nvocal traditions bear close resemblance to the\npolyharmonic\nsinging style common to\nSouth Africa\n.\n[\n35\n]\nForeign instruments such as the\nacoustic guitar\nand\npiano\nhave been adapted locally to create uniquely Malagasy forms of music. Contemporary Malagasy musical styles such as the\nsalegy\nor\ntsapika\nhave evolved from traditional styles modernized by the incorporation of\nelectric guitar\n,\nbass\n,\ndrums\nand\nsynthesizer\n. Many Western styles of popular music, including\nrock\n,\ngospel\n,\njazz\n,\nreggae\n,\nhip-hop\nand\nfolk rock\n, have also gained in popularity in Madagascar over the later half of the 20th century.\nCuisine and food\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMalagasy cuisine\nA street vendor selling fresh potato chips and traditional\nkaka pizon\nsnacks\nRice (\nvary\n) is the cornerstone of the Malagasy diet and is typically consumed at every meal. The accompaniment served with rice is called\nlaoka\nin the highlands dialect,\n[\n36\n]\nthe official version of the\nMalagasy language\n. Laoka are most often served in some kind of sauce: in the highlands, this sauce is generally tomato-based, while in coastal areas coconut milk is often added during cooking.\n[\n5\n]\nIn the arid southern and western interior where herding zebu is traditional, fresh or curdled zebu milk is often incorporated into vegetable dishes.\n[\n37\n]\nLaoka are diverse and may include such ingredients as Bambara groundnuts with pork, beef or fish;\ntrondro gasy\n(freshwater fish);\nRavitoto\n(shredded cassava leaves) with peanuts, beef or pork;\nhenan'omby\n(beef) or\nakoho\n(chicken) sauteed with ginger and garlic or simmered in its own juices (a preparation called\nritra\n); various types of seafood, which are more readily available along the coasts or in large urban centers; and many more.\n[\n38\n]\n[\n39\n]\nA variety of local greens such as\nanamamy\n(Morelle greens),\nanamafaitra\n(Martin greens) and particularly\nanamalao\n(\nparacress\n)\u2014distinguished by the mildly analgesic effect the boiled leaves and flowers produce\u2014are commonly sold alongside\nanandrano\n(\nwatercress\n) and\nanatsonga\n(\nbok choy\n).\n[\n40\n]\nIn the arid south and west, such as among the\nBara\nor\nTandroy\npeoples, staples include sweet potato, yams, taro root and especially cassava,\nmillet\nand maize, generally boiled in water and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts.\n[\n41\n]\nRo\n(broth) may be served as the main laoka or in addition to it to flavor and moisten the rice.\n[\n42\n]\nGarlic, onions, ginger, tomatoes, mild curry, and salt are the most common ingredients used to flavor dishes, and in coastal areas other ingredients such as coconut milk, vanilla, cloves or\nturmeric\nmay also be used.\n[\n43\n]\nA variety of condiments are served on the side and mixed into the rice or laoka according to each individual's taste rather than mixing them in as the food is being cooked.\n[\n44\n]\nThe most common and basic condiment,\nsakay\n, is a spicy condiment made from red or green chili pepper.\n[\n45\n]\nIndian-style condiments made of pickled mango, lemon, and other fruits (known as\nachards\nor\nlasary\n), are a coastal specialty;\n[\n46\n]\nin the highlands, lasary often refers to a salad of green beans, cabbage, carrots and onion in a\nvinaigrette\nsauce, popular as a side dish or as the filling of a baguette sandwich.\n[\n47\n]\nArchitecture\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nArchitecture of Madagascar\nThe architecture of Madagascar is unique in Africa, bearing strong resemblance to the\narchitecture of southern Borneo\nfrom which the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar are believed to have emigrated.\n[\n48\n]\nTraditional construction in this part of\nBorneo\n, also known as South\nKalimantan\n, is distinguished by rectangular houses raised on\npiles\n. The roof, which is supported by a central pillar, is steeply sloped; the gable beams cross to form roof horns that may be decoratively carved.\n[\n49\n]\nThe central Highlands of Madagascar are populated by the Merina, peoples who bear strong physiological and cultural resemblance to their Kalimantan ancestors; here, the traditional wooden houses of the aristocracy feature a central pillar (\nandry\n) supporting a steeply sloped roof decorated with roof horns (\ntandro-trano\n).\n[\n50\n]\nIn the southeast of Madagascar, actual zebu horns were traditionally affixed to the gable peak.\n[\n51\n]\nThroughout Madagascar, houses are rectangular with a gabled roof as in Kalimantan, central pillars are widespread, and in all but a handful of regions, traditional homes are built on piles in a manner handed down from generation to generation, regardless of whether the feature is suited to local conditions.\n[\n52\n]\nCertain cosmological and symbolic elements are common across Indonesian and Malagasy architecture as well.\n[\n50\n]\n[\n53\n]\nThe central house pillar is sacred in Kalimantan and Madagascar alike, and in both places, upon constructing a new house this pillar was often traditionally anointed with blood.\n[\n49\n]\n[\n50\n]\nThe features of the building or its dimensions (length, size, and particularly the height) are often symbolically indicative of the status of its occupants or the importance of its purpose on both islands.\n[\n50\n]\n[\n51\n]\nLikewise, both Madagascar and Borneo have a tradition of partially above-ground tomb construction\n[\n50\n]\nand the inhabitants of both islands practice the carving of decorative wooden funerary posts, called\naloalo\nin western Madagascar and\nklirieng\nin the Kajang dialect of Borneo.\n[\n49\n]\nRecreation and sports\n[\nedit\n]\nMoraingy is a traditional martial art of Madagascar.\nA number of traditional pastimes have emerged in Madagascar.\nMoraingy\n, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate.\n[\n54\n]\nThe wrestling of zebu cattle (\ntolon'omby\n) is also practiced in many regions.\n[\n55\n]\nIn addition to sports, a wide variety of games are played. Among the most emblematic is\nfanorona\n, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King\nAndrianjaka\nafter his father\nRalambo\nwas partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing\nfanorona\nto the detriment of his other responsibilities.\n[\n56\n]\nWestern recreational activities were introduced to Madagascar over the past two centuries.\nRugby\nis considered the national sport of Madagascar.\n[\n57\n]\nFootball (soccer)\nis also popular. Madagascar has produced a world champion in\np\u00e9tanque\n, a French game similar to\nlawn bowling\n, which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands.\n[\n58\n]\nSchool athletics programs typically include soccer, track and field, judo, boxing, women's basketball and women's tennis. Madagascar sent its first competitors to the\nOlympic Games in 1964\nand has also competed in the\nAfrican Games\n.\n[\n59\n]\nScouting\nis represented in Madagascar by its\nown local federation\nof three scouting clubs. Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14,905.\n[\n60\n]\nPopular media\n[\nedit\n]\nCinema\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nCinema of Madagascar\nRex and Riz cinemas in Antananarivo, Madagascar.\nIn 1975, the Malagasy government nationalized the movie theatres and established the Office du Cinema Malgache.\n[\n61\n]\nThe national film industry, although very much in its infancy, is influenced by\nNollywood\n(\nNigerian cinema\n) and\nFrench cinema\n.\n[\n62\n]\n[\n63\n]\nThe most notable director is\nRaymond Rajaonarivelo\n, director of movies such as\nQuand Les Etoiles Rencontrent La Mer\n(\nWhen the Stars Meet the Sea\n) and\nTabataba\n(\nThe Spreading of Rumors\n).\n[\n63\n]\nThe\nZebu d'or\n(Golden Zebu) of the annual film festival\nRencontres du Film Court Madagascar\nis an award given to honor the best films and artists in the industry.\nThere are two cinemas in\nAntananarivo\nand one in\nMahajanga\n, all dating from the colonial era, but none show standard international releases or operate on a regular schedule. These venues instead occasionally screen Malagasy films or are used for private events and religious services. Hollywood blockbuster films and some international films, particularly including martial arts, horror and action releases, are typically broadcast on television and purchased as bootleg DVDs or digital media files in major urban areas.\nBruce Lee\nhas historically been very popular in Madagascar.\n[\n64\n]\nIn smaller towns, films are often shown at improvised movie houses typically consisting of benches in a room fitted with a television and video player.\n[\n65\n]\nMost films are dubbed into French.\n[\n64\n]\nNotes\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nBlench, Roger (1982). \"Evidence for the Indonesian origins of certain elements of African culture\".\nAfrican Music\n.\n6\n(2):\n81\u2013\n93.\ndoi\n:\n10.21504/amj.v6i2.1118\n.\nJSTOR\n30249759\n.\n^\nKus, Susan; Raharijaona, Victor (2000). \"House to Palace, Village to State: Scaling up Architecture and Ideology\".\nAmerican Anthropologist\n.

    "Mali": "A crowd of\nwomen in Mali\n.\nThe\nculture of\nMali\nderives from the shared experience, as a colonial and post-colonial polity, and the interaction of the numerous cultures which make up the Malian people. What is today the nation of Mali was united first in the medieval period as the\nMali Empire\n. While the current state does not include areas in the southwest, and is expanded far to the east and northeast, the dominant roles of the\nMand\u00e9 people\nis shared by the modern Mali, and the empire from which its name originates from.\nSonghay\n,\nBozo\n, and\nDogon\npeople predominate, while the\nFula people\n, formerly nomadic, have settled in patches across the nation. Tuareg and Maure people continue a largely nomadic desert culture, across the north of the nation. The interaction of these communities (along with dozens of other smaller ethnicities) have created a Malian culture, marked by\nheterogeneity\n, as well as syntheses where these traditions intermix\nEthnic patchwork and intermixing\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nDemographics of Mali\nA\nDogon\nhunter with an old\nflintlock\nrifle still in use.\nMande people share a caste system in which certain skills (metalworking, fishing, history-keeping) are passed down through families. The rituals and cultural associations of these activities have spread far beyond the Mande communities themselves.\nWhile the\nMalink\u00e9\n-\nDyula\n, and\nBambara\npeople form a Mande core (at around 50%) of Malian culture in the densely populated regions of the south and east, a mosaic of other cultures also contribute to Malian society.\nThe\nFula people\n, originally nomadic but now as often village and city dwelling, are scattered in communities across the nation as they are over much of West Africa. Fula peoples were amongst the first and most fervent believers in\nIslam\n, which orders the lives of the vast majority of Malians. The Fula traditions of nomadic cattle herding has bequeathed values of mobility and independence, and at the same time created networks of mutual dependence between certain communities and cultures.  The Fula transhumance cycle meant that entire Fula tribes would spend seasons living in Bambara communities, creating formalized relationships called\nCousinage\n.\n[\n1\n]\nThis survives to this day as the Malian cultural institution known as\nsanankuya\n, or the \"joking relationship\".  In Mali, the state of\nMacina\n, in the midst of the\nInner Niger Delta\nwas dominated by Fula people and culture.\n[\n2\n]\nDogon\nand\nSonghay\npeople are dominant in the east of the country, with the\nSonghay Empire\npushing traditionally animist\nDogon\ndeep into the isolating hill country of the southeast.

Red, the symbol of happiness, is the dominant colour. Food is piled up to ensure abundance during the year and the traditional wax cake is distributed to relatives and friends. Firecrackers are lit to ward off evil spirits.\nThaipoosam Cavadee\nJanuary or February, dependent on the\nTamil Calendar\nHindu Festival\n;\nTamil Community\nCavadee is celebrated in January/February, more precisely by the\nTamil\ncommunity in Mauritius. Along with the fire-walking and sword-climbing ceremonies, Cavadee is among the most spectacular Tamil events.

Celebrated in October/November it marks the victory of righteousness over evil in the Hindu mythology. Traditionally, clay oil lamps were placed in front of every home turning the island into a fairyland of flickering lights; these have now been replaced mostly by decorative electric lights.\nEid ul-Fitr\nAny time of year because Islam is based on a lunar calendar\nMuslim Festival\nThe exact date of this festival is subject to confirmation as its celebration depends on the visibility of the moon. Eid-ul-Fitr is celebrated to mark the end of\nRamadan\n, the Muslim holy month of fasting. It is a day of thanksgiving and rejoicing for Muslims.

Mauritius of all background wears bright colours, especially Mauritian women. Flip-flops (locally known as 'savat') are worn by all Mauritian regardless of their cultural background, which are suitable for the Mauritian climate. Beachwear and tight/revealing clothing is acceptable in many\nresorts\nbut they are not considered appropriate in towns and villages. Both Western-style clothing and Traditional ethnic clothing are worn in Mauritius.\n[\n12\n]\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMauritian cuisine\nA\nMauritian Creole\ndish of\ncurry\nwith\nrice\nand a\nsalad\nThe\ncuisine\nof Mauritius is a blend of\nAfrican\n,\nFrench\nand other\nEuropean\ncuisines, as well as\nChinese\n, and\nIndian\ninfluences. It is common for a combination of cuisines to form part of the same meal.\nBeef\nand\npork\nare not commonly found in restaurants given dietary restrictions of Hindus and Muslims.\nMauritius has had strong ties with French culture throughout its history and was left with a very French \"savoir vivre\". Even today, the popularity of French dishes like the\nbouillon\n,\ntuna salad\n,\ndaube\n, civet de li\u00e8vre or\ncoq au vin\nserved with good wine show the prevalence of French culture in Mauritius. As the years passed by, some have been adapted to the more exotic ingredients of the island to confer some unique flavour.\nDuring the 19th century, after the abolition of slavery, Indian workers who migrated to Mauritius brought their cuisine with them. Those indentured labourers came from different parts of India, each with their own culinary tradition, depending on the region. Traces of both northern and southern Indian cuisine can be found in Mauritius. Some common preparations are\ncurry\n,\nchutney\n,\nrougaille poisson sale\n(\ntomato paste\nthat is very popular with\nfish\n) and\npickles\n, most of which use local ingredients. The Mauritian versions of those dishes have a local flavour and differ, at times considerably, from the original Indian recipes.\nThe end of the 19th century saw the arrival of Chinese migrants, who came mostly from the south-eastern part of China. They are largely credited with making\nrice\n, the\nstaple diet\nof the island, and making\nnoodles\n, both steamed and fried, popular. Chinese appetizers such as\ntaken\n(local version of the\nspring roll\nwith a flour batter replacing the traditional rolled wrapping), crispy chicken and crispy squid have become part of the Mauritian folklore. Furthermore, Chinese and other Asian restaurants are present all around the island, and offer a variety of\nchicken\n,\nsquid\n,\nmutton\nand\nfish\ndishes, most typically prepared in\nblack bean\nsauce or\noyster sauce\n. Mauritian families often consider dinner at an Asian restaurant a treat.\nAlong the years, each of the country's communities has adapted and mixed each other's cuisine to their liking.\nThe production of\nrum\nis common throughout the island.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nSugar cane\nwas first introduced on the island when the Dutch colonised it in 1638. Even then, the propensity of making rum out of sugar cane was strongly recognised. Sugar cane was mainly cultivated for the production of \"\narrack\n\", a precursor to rum. Only much later, after almost 60 years, was the first proper sugar produced.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nHowever, it was during the French and English administration that sugar production was fully exploited, which considerably contributed to the economic development of the island.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nIt was Pierre Charles Fran\u00e7ois Harel who in 1850 initially proposed the concept of a local distillation of rum in Mauritius. In part due to his efforts, Mauritius today houses three distilleries (Grays, Medine and St Aubin) and is in the process of opening an additional three.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nWhile not as famed as its Caribbean counterparts from\nCuba\n,\nJamaica\nor\nBarbados\n, Mauritian rum is slowly gaining exposure on the international stage and is considered by local stakeholders as an area of potential growth.\nLanguage and Literature\n[\nedit\n]\nLanguage\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLanguages of Mauritius\nCurrently, the official language of Mauritius is\nEnglish language\n.\n[\n5\n]\n:\u200a21\nThe British colonial legacy in Mauritius is reflected in the use of English language in governmental documents and communications; however, English is rarely used in public life and in daily conversation.\n[\n18\n]\n:\u200a805\nMauritians working in the tourism industry are however fluent in English; English is also taught in school and is the working language of government and businesses.\n[\n5\n]\n:\u200a21\nFrench is the ancestral language of the\nFranco-Mauritians\n.\n[\n1\n]\nThe presence of French settlers left an important mark on the ethnic composition of Mauritius in the form of the\nFranco-Mauritians\n; despite being a minority group, the Franco-Mauritians strongly affected the rest of the population through the use of the\nFrench language\n.\n[\n18\n]\n:\u200a805\nAs the French language was associated with\nhigh culture\nin Mauritius, the educated and the business class commonly spoke French.\n[\n18\n]\n:\u200a805\nNowadays, business and social aspects of life, as well as in the media (including daily newspapers\n[\n5\n]\n:\u200a21\n), literature and many cultural expressions in Mauritius, are, however, dominated by French language.\n[\n18\n]\n:\u200a805\nMost Mauritians are more comfortable speaking French than English,\n[\n5\n]\n:\u200a21\nand is used by all ethnic groups.\n[\n1\n]\nMauritian Creole\nevolved from the\npidgin\nused by the French slave masters of the 18th century to communicate with their slaves and incorporated words from African and Malagasy dialects. Mauritian Creole is understood and spoken by all Mauritians regardless of ethnic background.\n[\n5\n]\n:\u200a21\nMauritian Creole was initially not taught at school due to what was considered 'a lack of prestige' due to its association with the local Creole population and was perceived as a form of 'broken French'.\n[\n1\n]\nIt is only in January 2012 that Mauritian Creole was officially introduced in the\nNational Curriculum Framework\n[\n28\n]\nand became an optional language subject for primary school students.\n[\n29\n]\nMost ethnic groups in Mauritius have an ancestral language.\n[\n1\n]\nDue the presence of Mauritians of Indian and Chinese descent, Asian languages, which include\nBhojpuri\n,\nHindi\n,\nMandarin\n,\nMarathi\n,\nTamil\n,\nTelugu\n, and\nUrdu\n, are commonly spoken.\n[\n1\n]\nMost of these languages act as significant religious and ethnic identity markers.\n[\n1\n]\nOriental languages are taught at schools, and the ethnic background of a student predominately influences his choice of oriental language.\n[\n1\n]\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMauritian literature\nWhile\nkreol morisien\n(\nMauritian Creole\n) is the most spoken language on in Mauritius, most of the literature is written in\nFrench\n, although many authors write in\nEnglish\n,\nBhojpuri\n, and Morisien (\nMauritian Creole\n), and others such as\nAbhimanyu Unnuth\nin\nHindi\n.  Mauritius's renowned playwright\nDev Virahsawmy\nwrites exclusively in Morisyen.\nImportant authors include\nEug\u00e9nie Poujade\n,\nMalcolm de Chazal\n,\nAnanda Devi\n, Raymond Chasle,\nLoys Masson\n,\nMarcel Cabon\n, and\nEdouard Maunick\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nLindsey Collen\nhas been able to carve out a meeting of imaginaries in the unique social setup of this multi-faceted country. Other younger writers like Shenaz Patel,\nAmal Sewtohul\n, Natacha Appanah, Alain Gordon-Gentil and Carl de Souza explore the issues of ethnicity, superstition and politics in the novel. Poet and critic\nKhal Torabully\nhas put forward the concept of \"coolitude\", a poetics that results from the blend of Indian and Mauritian cultural diversity. Other poets include Hassam Wachill, Edouard Maunick, Sedley Assone, Yusuf Kadel and Umar Timol.\nThe island plays host to the coveted Le Prince Maurice Prize, a literary award celebrating and recognizing 'writers of the heart'. The award is designed to highlight the literary love story in all its forms rather than for pure Romantic Fiction. In keeping with the island's literary culture the prize alternates on a yearly basis between English-speaking and French-speaking writers.\nLegends and folklore stories\n[\nedit\n]\nMany people in Mauritius, in particular those living in rural areas, believe in witchcraft and paranormal activities; this is very likely to be the combination of African, Malagasy, Indian, Chinese and European folk traditions.\n[\n12\n]\nCal\u00e8che de Lallmatie\n[\nedit\n]\nCal\u00e8che de Lallmatie (lit. \"\nChariot\nof Lallmatie\" in English) is a Mauritian legend around the village of\nLallmatie\nwhich says that two women dressed in white riding two white horses were seen at night, close to midnight.\n[\n30\n]\nThe legend appeared some years prior to the appearance of\nTouni Mniwi\nphenomenon.\n[\n30\n]\nLougarou\n[\nedit\n]\nLougarou (lit. \"\nwerewolf\n\" in English; from the French term \"Loup garou\") is a notorious figure which appears in Mauritian folklore, which is mostly used to scare children; its appearance may result from the combination of French and African folklore stories. The Lougarou appears at full moon and brings trouble to the local population. Protection against the Lougarou is believed to be given if a person consults a\nlonganis\n(i.e. a local sorcerer) or a\ntreter\n(i.e. witch doctor).\n[\n12\n]\nTouni Minwi\n[\nedit\n]\nThe legend of\nTouni Minwi\n(lit. \"Naked at Midnight\") appeared in 1994 following\nCyclone Hollanda\n; the cyclone had led to the destruction of many houses and electricity shortages.\n[\n31\n]\nTouni Minwi was supposedly a form of Lougarou,\n[\n30\n]\nwho would visit women in their homes at night.\n[\n31\n]\nThis led to hysteria among the local population; many witnesses would affirm having seen frightful manifestations at night time, including apparitions of Lougarou.  The Touni Minwi phenomenon led to a large mobilization of people in the capital,\nPort Louis\n, and in the village of\nLallmatie\n.\n[\n31\n]\n[\n30\n]\nMountain-related legends or folk stories\n[\nedit\n]\nLe Morne Brabant and the Maroons\n[\nedit\n]\nAccording to the legend, the maroons decided to jump to their death from\nLe Morne Brabant\nwhen they misunderstood the presence of a group of soldiers who were supposed to inform them that they were emancipated following the Slavery Abolition Act passed by the British.\n[\n32\n]\nFearing recapture and being returned to their former masters, they decided to commit suicide.\n[\n32\n]\nPieter Both and the Milkman\n[\nedit\n]\nPieter Both Mountain, Mauritius. The rock at the tip of the mountain is believed to be a milkman turned into stone according to the local legends.\nPieter Both Mountain\nis one of the most emblematic places in Mauritius; it is characterized by a rock which looks like a human head on its top. According to a famous local legend, a milkman from the village of Cr\u00e8ve Coeur (which is also located at the foot of the mountain) used to sell milk in the surrounding villages. One day, the milkman decided to take a shortcut through Pieter Both to reach the next village; when walking, he felt tired and decided to rest. When he woke up, he saw fairies dancing and singing; the fairies told him not to tell anyone about what they saw or he would be turned into stone. The milkman, however, could not prevent himself and told the story to his friends. When the milkman returned to Pieter Both, the fairies knew that he did not keep the secret and turned him into stone. The head of milkman is the top of the mountain. The rock, which is perched on the tip of Pieter Both, is therefore believed to be the milkman.\n[\n33\n]\nLandmarks, architecture, and monuments of significance\n[\nedit\n]\nWorld Heritage Sites\n[\nedit\n]\nAapravasi Ghat\n[\nedit\n]\nOld monument at Aapravasi Ghat Museum, Port Louis, Mauritius\nThe\nAapravasi Ghat\nis found in the bay of Trou Fanfaron in Port Louis; it is the place where indentured Indian labour system started. In 1834, following the emancipation of slaves, the British used Mauritius as their first site to experiment the use of contracted 'free (indentured) labour' from the poorest parts of India to replace the use of slaves. The Aapravasi Ghat is the remnants of an immigration depot built in 1849 to receive the influx of indentured labourers coming from India, Eastern Africa, Madagascar, China and Southeast Asia to start a new life of work on the sugar plantations. The Aapravasi Ghat site is owned by the Ministry of Arts and Culture. The property is protected as National Heritage under the National Heritage Fund Act 2003 and the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund Act 2001.\n[\n34\n]\nIt was listed in the World Heritage List in 2006.\n[\n35\n]\nLe Morne Cultural Landscape\n[\nedit\n]\nLe Morne Brabant\nis found in the southwest of Mauritius; it used to shelter escaped slaves, called maroons, throughout the 18th to 19th centuries. The Mauritian oral traditions associated with the maroons have made Le Morne a symbol of the slaves\u2019 fight for freedom, their suffering, and their sacrifice.\n[\n35\n]\nIt was listed in the World Heritage List in 2008.\n[\n35\n]\nThe\nInternational Slave Route Monument\n, located at the foot of Le Morne Brabant, was established in 2009 due to its association with a historical and legendary place, called the 'Valley of Bones'.\n[\n36\n]\nAccording to the legend, the maroons decided to jump to their death from Le Morne Brabant when they misunderstood the presence of a group of soldiers who were supposed to inform them that they were emancipated following the Slavery Abolition Act passed by the British.\n[\n32\n]\nFearing to be recaptured and be returned to their former masters, they decided to commit suicide.\n[\n32\n]\nChinese Cultural Landmarks\n[\nedit\n]\nChinatown of Mauritius, Port Louis\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nChinatowns in Africa\nChinatown of Mauritius, Port Louis, 1960s\nThe\nChinatown\nof Mauritius is situated in\nPort Louis\n.

This sphere may include, among others, the fields of personal or collective behaviors, language, customs, knowledge, beliefs, arts, legislation, gastronomy, music, poetry, architecture, etc. While\nMorocco\nstarted to be stably predominantly\nSunni Muslim\nstarting from 9th\u201310th century AD, during the\nAlmoravid\nperiod, a very significant Andalusi culture was imported, contributing to the shaping of Moroccan culture.\n[\n5\n]\nAnother major influx of Andalusi culture was brought by Andalusis with them following their expulsion from Al-Andalus to\nNorth Africa\nafter the\nReconquista\n.\n[\n3\n]\nIn antiquity, starting from the second century A.D and up to the seventh, a rural\nDonatist\nChristianity\nwas present, along an urban still-in-the-making\nRoman Catholicism\n.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nAll of the cultural super strata tend to rely on a multi-millennial aboriginal Berber substratum still present and dating back to prehistoric times.\nThe linguistic landscape of Morocco is complex. It generally tends to be horizontally diverse and vertically stratified. It is though possible to broadly classify it into two main components: Arab and Berber. It is hardly possible to speculate about the origin of Berber languages as it is traced back to low antiquity and prehistoric times.\n[\n8\n]\nThe\nSemitic\ninfluence, on the contrary, can be fairly documented by archaeological evidence.\n[\n9\n]\nIt came in two waves:\nCanaanite\n, in its\nPunic\n, Carthaginian and\nHebrew\nhistoric varieties, from the ninth century B.C and up to high antiquity, and\nArabic\n, during the low Middle Ages, starting from the seventh century A.D. The two Semitic languages being close, both in syntax and vocabulary it is hard to tell them apart as to who influenced more the structure of the modern\nMoroccan Arabic dialect\n.\n[\n10\n]\nThe Arab conquerors having certainly encountered large romanized urban\nPunic\npopulation as they advanced.\n[\n11\n]\nIn any case, the linguistic and cultural identity of Morocco, just as its geography would predict, is the result of the encounter of three main circles: Arab, Berber, and Western Mediterranean European.\nThe two official\nlanguages of Morocco\nare\nModern Standard Arabic\nand\nStandard Moroccan Berber\n. According to the 2024 general census, 92.7% of Moroccans speak\nMoroccan Arabic\n, while 24.8% speak a\nBerber language\n, in its\nTarifit\n(3.2%),\nCentral Atlas Tamazight\n(7.4%), or\nTashelhit\n(14.2%) varieties.\n[\n12\n]\nThe census also indicated that 80.6% of Moroccans consider Arabic to be their native language, while 18.9% regard any of the various Berber languages as their mother tongue.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nLanguage\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nLanguages of Morocco\n,\nArabic\n, and\nBerber languages\nModern Standard Arabic\nand\nStandard Moroccan Berber\nare the official languages of Morocco,\n[\n14\n]\nwhile\nMoroccan Arabic\nis the national\nvernacular\ndialect;\n[\n15\n]\nBerber languages are spoken in some mountain areas, such as\nTarifit\n, spoken by 3.2%,\nCentral Atlas Tamazight\n, spoken by 7.4%, and\nTashelhit\n, spoken by 14.2%.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nAccording to the 2024 census, 99.2%, or almost the entire literate population of Morocco, could read and write in Arabic, whereas only 1.5% of the population could read and write in Berber.\n[\n12\n]\nVarieties of\nJudeo-Arabic\nhave also traditionally been spoken in Morocco.\n[\n16\n]\nForeign languages, particularly French, English, and Spanish, are also spoken in urban centers such as\nTangier\nor\nCasablanca\n. With all of these languages,\ncode-switching\nis an omnipresent phenomenon in Moroccan speech and media.\n[\n17\n]\nArabic\n[\nedit\n]\nClassical Arabic\n, a formal rather than\nnatural language\n, is used primarily in formal, academic, and religious settings.\n[\n18\n]\nMoroccan Arabic\n, in its various regional and contextual forms, is used more often in casual situations, at home, and on the street.\n[\n19\n]\nHassaniya\nis another\ndialect of Arabic\nspoken in the south of Morocco.\n[\n20\n]\nBerber languages\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are three main varieties of Berber languages spoken in Morocco.\nTashelhit\n(also known locally as\nSoussia\n) is spoken in southwest Morocco, including the High Atlas and the Sous valley.\nCentral Atlas Tamazight\nis spoken in the\nMiddle Atlas\nand southeast Morocco; for example, around\nKhenifra\nand\nMidelt\n.\nTarifit\nis spoken in the\nRif\narea of northern Morocco in towns like\nNador\n,\nAl Hoceima\n, and\nAjdir\n.\n[\n21\n]\n[\n22\n]\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMoroccan literature\nA\nfolio\nof an 18th-century Moroccan\nQuran\n, with a characteristically\nMaghrebi script\nused to write\nsurahs\n105\u2013114\nMoroccan literature is the literature produced by people who lived in or were culturally connected to\nMorocco\nand the historical states that have existed partially or entirely within the geographical area that is now Morocco.

Since the 1990s\u20132000s Moroccan cities have welcomed institutions that contribute to the diffusion of contemporary art and the visual arts: L'appartement 22 and Radio Apartment 22 in Rabat,\n[\n38\n]\n[\n39\n]\nthe\nCin\u00e9math\u00e8que de Tanger\nin Tangier,\nLa Source du Lion\nin Casablanca, Dar Al-Ma'm\u00fbn residency and center, the Marrakech Art Fair, and the\nMarrakech Biennale\n, all in Marrakech.\nLocal art galleries such as Galerie Villa Delaporte, Atelier 21, Galerie Matisse and Galerie FJ are also platforms showing contemporary artwork and contributing to its development.\n[\n40\n]\nThe global art market also influences the development and visibility of contemporary art in Morocco; international exhibitions such as \"Africa Remix\" (2004) and \"Uneven Geographies\" (2010) featured contemporary artists from North Africa, including Moroccan ones. Regional events such as the\nDakar Biennale\n(or Dak'Art \u2013 Biennale de l'Art Africain Contemporain), a major\ncontemporary African art\nexhibition, gives greater visibility to artists from the African continent.\nTaburida\n, a traditional Arab exhibition of horsemanship performed during festivals\n[\n41\n]\nMoroccan artists and their initiatives\n[\nedit\n]\nArtists born in Morocco or with Moroccan origins include\nMounir Fatmi\n, Latifa Echackhch, Mohamed El Baz, Bouchra Khalili,\nMajida Khattari\n, Mehdi-Georges Lahlou, and Younes Baba-Ali.\n[\n42\n]\nMoroccan artists have devised several initiatives to help develop a contemporary art market in the country. For example, Hassan Darsi created La Source du Lion in 1995, an art studio that welcomes artists-in-residence, and Bouchra Khalili and\nYto Barrada\nfounded the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que de Tanger in 2003, which is dedicated to promoting Moroccan cinematographic culture.\n[\n43\n]\nA group of seven Moroccan artists, among them\nAmina Benbouchta\n, Hassan Echair, Jamila Lamrani,\nSaf\u00e2a Erruas\nand Youn\u00e8s Rahmoun, formed \"Collectif 212\" to exhibit their work at Le Cube, an independent art room.

The art movement began over 50 years ago at the center of Marrakech, in the bustling market place of\nJemaa el-Fna\n, when a group of abstract artists\n[\n46\n]\ngot together and exhibited their work. The exhibit lasted for 10 days and is considered the beginning of a movement in modern and contemporary art. It has been gaining recognition throughout the African continent and globally ever since.\nMarrakech\nhas emerged as the \"art capital\" of Morocco. It houses numerous art museums including the Farid Belkahia Museum, named after one of the leading\nJemaa el-Fna\nartists who died in 2014. Marrakech is home to the\nYves Saint Laurent Museum\nand hosts the annual\nMarrakech International Film Festival\n.\nTangier\nis another center for art, producing renowned artists like\nAhmed Yacoubi\nand\nAbdellatif Zine\nand Mohamed Hamri whose works are displayed around the world.\nTattooing\n[\nedit\n]\nTattooing\nwas once a popular tradition in the\nMaghreb\n, particularly among rural\nBerber\npopulations.\n[\n47\n]\nPhotography\n[\nedit\n]\nJoseph Bouhsira\n, active in Fes, was one of the first\nMoroccan photographers\n.\n[\n48\n]\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMoroccan cuisine\nThis section\nneeds expansion\n.

This has heavily influenced Moroccan cuisine as all of these are used in abundance. Morocco is known for dishes such as\ncouscous\n,\ntajine\n, and\npastilla\n. Moroccan cuisine uses many herbs, including\ncilantro\n,\nparsley\n, and\nmint\n; spices such as\ncinnamon\n,\nturmeric\n,\nginger\n,\ncumin\n, and\nsaffron\n; and produce such as tomatoes, onions, garlic, zucchini, bell peppers, and\neggplant\n. One of the defining features of Moroccan cuisine is the interplay between sweet and savory flavors, as exemplified by\ntfaya\n, a mix of caramelized onions, butter, cinnamon, sugar, and raisins often served with meat.\n[\n50\n]\nHistorically, couscous has been the staple of the Moroccan diet. On special occasions, more complex meals like the traditional Moroccan\npastilla\nand some special pastries such as\ngazelle ankles\nand\nbriwates\nare served for guests.\n[\n51\n]\nMint tea, called\natay\nin Morocco, is commonly regarded as the national beverages.

The rhythm of life for Moroccans is dictated by religious celebrations throughout the year, such as\nRamadan\nand\nEid Al Adha\n. During these celebrations, most of them being public holidays, Moroccans focus on praying and spending time with their family. Moroccans also celebrate\nal-Mawlid al-Nabawi\n, the birthday of\nMuhammad\n, and the\nIslamic New Year\n.\nOther religious celebrations include the\nFriday weekly prayer\nwhere most Moroccans go to the mosque for the Friday mid-day prayer.\n[\n52\n]\nJewish holidays\n[\nedit\n]\nJewish Wedding in Morocco\nby\nEug\u00e8ne Delacroix\n,\nLouvre\n, Paris\nMorocco has long had a significant Jewish population, distinguished by traditions particular to\nMoroccan Jews\n.

The djellaba has a hood that comes to a point called a\nqob\n. The\nqob\nprotects the wearer from the sun or in colder climates, like the mountains, the\nqob\nkeeps in body heat and protects the face from falling snow. For special occasions, men also wear a red cap called a\nbernousse\n, more commonly referred to as a\nFez\n. Women wear\nkaftans\n(\n\u0642\u0641\u0637\u0627\u0646\n) decorated with ornaments. Nearly all men, and most women, wear\nbalgha\n(\n\u0628\u0644\u063a\u0629\n) \u2014- soft leather slippers with no heel, often dyed yellow. Women also wear high-heeled\nsandals\n, often with silver or gold\ntinsel\n.\nThe distinction between a\ndjellaba\nand a\nkaftan\nis the hood on the\ndjellaba\n, which a\nkaftan\nlacks.

The Andalusi garden, which usually features a burbling fountain, has an important role in cooling\nriads\n: the evaporation of water is an\nendothermic\nchemical reaction, which absorbs heat from the area garden and surrounding rooms.\nMorocco has many beautiful gardens, including the\nMajorelle Garden\nin\nMarrakech\nand the\nAndalusian\nGarden in the\nKasbah of the Udayas\nin\nRabat\n.\nDomestic architecture\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHistoric house architecture in Morocco\nA window displaying a wrought iron window grill in\nAsila\n. The knots are tied with bent metal in the traditional way, rather than\nsoldered\n.\nDar\n(Arabic:\n\u062f\u0627\u0631\n), the name given to one of the most common types of domestic structures in Morocco, is a home found in a\nmedina\n, or walled urban area of a city.  Most Moroccan homes traditionally adhere to the\nDar al-Islam\n, a series of tenets on Islamic domestic life.\n[\n77\n]\nDar\nexteriors are typically devoid of ornamentation and windows, except occasional small openings in secondary quarters, such as stairways and service areas.  These piercings provide light and ventilation.\n[\n78\n]\nDars\nare typically composed of thick, high walls that protect inhabitants from thievery, animals, and other such hazards; however, they have a much more symbolic value from an Arabic perspective. In this culture the exterior represents a place of work, while the interior represents a place of refuge.\n[\n79\n]\nThus, Moroccan interiors are often very lavish in decoration and craft.\nConsistent with most\nIslamic architecture\n,\ndars\nare based around small open-air patios, surrounded by very tall thick walls, to block direct light and minimize heat.\n[\n78\n]\nIntermediary triple-arched porticos lead to usually two to four symmetrically located rooms.  These rooms have to be long and narrow, creating very vertical spaces, because the regional resources and construction technology typically only allow for joists that are usually less than thirteen feet.\n[\n78\n]\nUpon entering a\ndar\n, guests move through a zigzagging passageway that hides the central courtyard. The passageway opens to a staircase leading to an upstairs reception area called a\ndormiria\n, which often is the most lavish room in the home adorned with decorative tilework, painted furniture, and piles of embroidered pillows and\nMoroccan rugs\n.  More affluent families also have greenhouses and a second\ndormiria\n, accessible from a street-level staircase.  Service quarters and stairways were always at the corners of the structures.\n[\n78\n]\nZiliij\n[\nedit\n]\nZiliij\n(\nArabic\n:\n\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0644\u064a\u062c\n), colorful geometric mosaic tile work, is a\ndecorative art\nand architectural element commonly found in Moroccan mosques, mausolea, homes, and palaces.

    "Mozambique": "The\nculture of\nMozambique\nis in large part derived from its history of\nBantu\n,\nSwahili\n,  and\nPortuguese\nrule, and has expanded since independence in 1975. The majority of its inhabitants are black Africans. Its main language is\nPortuguese\n. Its median religion is\nRoman Catholicism\n, but only about 40% of the inhabitants are\nChristian\n. It has a rich history in the areas of arts, cuisine, and entertainment.\nPeople\n[\nedit\n]\nThe main ethnic groups in Mozambique are Makhuwa, Tsonga, Makonde, Shangaan, Shona, Sena, Ndau, and other indigenous groups. There are approximately 45,000 Europeans, and 15,000 South Asians. The main religious groups in Mozambique are Christian (57%), Muslim (20%), Indigenous African, and other beliefs.\nHealth is an expansive concern in Mozambique. With limited resources and funds, the life prospects for Mozambicans are relatively low when placed in comparison to other nations, and comparable when compared to neighboring states. The infant mortality rate for 2016, has been calculated at 67.9/1,000.\n[\n1\n]\nThe overall life expectancy is approximately 55 years.\n[\n2\n]\nWorkforce: Agriculture\u201481%; industry\u20146%; services\u201413%\nLanguages\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLanguages of Mozambique\nThe official language is Portuguese,\nEnglish\nis sometimes spoken in major cities such as\nMaputo\nand\nBeira\n. According to the 2007 census, 50.4% of the national population aged 5 and older (80.8% of people living in urban areas and 36.3% in rural areas) is fluent in Portuguese, making it the most widely spoken language in the country.\n[\n3\n]\nThe other languages spoken in Mozambique include Emakhuwa (at 25.3%), Xichangana (at 10.3%), Cisena (at 7.5%), Elomwe (at 7%), Echuwabo (at 5.1%), and a variety of other languages.\n[\n4\n]\nReligion and education\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nReligion in Mozambique\nand\nEducation in Mozambique\nMost of the people in Mozambique practice native beliefs and are Christians, mostly\nRoman Catholics\nand some\nProtestants\n.\nChristianity\nis a Portuguese influence. A few\nMuslims\n(mostly\nArabs\nand\nBlacks\nin northern part of the country),\nBuddhists\n(mostly\nMahayana\nand\nChinese\n), and\nHindus\n(virtually\nIndian\nand\nPakistani\n) are also important.\nOnly 1/3 of Mozambicans over the age of 15 are able to read and write.\nPrimary education\nin Mozambique is free. However,\nsecondary education\nis not free. At the end of 1995, about 60% of primary school aged children attended Primary School. A very small percentage of these students, about 7%, move onto\nsecondary school\n.\nAt the end of the 1995 calendar year, there were approximately seven thousand students that attended one of the three higher level institutions.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nMedia\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMedia of Mozambique\nArts\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nmusic of Mozambique\ncan serve many purposes, ranging from religious expression to traditional ceremonies. Musical instruments are usually handmade. Some of the instruments used in Mozambican musical expression include\ndrums\nmade of wood and animal skin; the\nlupembe\n, a woodwind instrument made from animal horns or wood; and the\nmarimba\n, which is a kind of\nxylophone\nnative to Mozambique. The marimba is a popular instrument with the\nChopi\nof the south central coast who are famous for their musical skill and dance. Some\n[\nwho?\n]\nwould say that Mozambique's music is similar to\nreggae\nand\nWest Indian\ncalypso\n. Other music types are popular in Mozambique like\nmarrabenta\n, and other\nLusophone music\nforms like\nfado\n,\nsamba\n,\nbossa nova\n, and\nmaxixe\n(with origins from\nMaxixe\nand\nKizomba\n).\nThe\nMakonde\nare renowned for their wood carving and elaborate masks that are commonly used in ritual dances. There are two different kinds of wood carvings.\nShetani\n(evil spirits), which are mostly carved in heavy\nebony\n, tall, and elegantly curved with symbols and nonrepresentational faces. The\nujamaa\nare totem-type carvings which illustrate lifelike faces of people and various figures. These sculptures are usually referred to as \u201cfamily trees\u201d because they tell stories of many generations.\nDuring the last years of the colonial period, Mozambican art reflected the oppression by the colonial power, and became symbol of the resistance. After independence in 1975, the modern art came into a new phase. The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists are the painter\nMalangatana Ngwenya\nand the sculptor\nAlberto Chissano\n. Also a lot of the post-independence art during the 1980s and 1990s reflect the political struggle, civil war, suffering, starvation, and struggle.\nDances\nare usually intricate, highly developed traditions throughout Mozambique. There are many different kinds of dances from tribe to tribe which are usually ritualistic in nature. The Chopi, for instance, act out battles dressed in animal skins. The men of\nMakua\ndress in colourful outfits and masks while dancing on stilts around the village for hours. Groups of women in the northern part of the country perform a traditional dance called\ntufo\n, to celebrate\nIslamic\nholidays.\n[\n5\n]\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMozambican cuisine\nMozambican cuisine is rich and varied, reflecting both its traditional roots as well as outside influences. Flavourful spicy stews eaten with rice or steamed cornmeal dough are common.\nWith its long coastline and rich fishing presence, fish is a key part of the national diet. The country is famous for its shellfish, such as prawns and crayfish, and its combination of seafood dishes with the spicy\npiri-piri\nsauce (which literally translates to \"Spicy-Spicy\").\nOne particular stew that is without Portuguese influence is\nmatapa\n, which is usually made with cassava leaves, cashews, crab, shrimp and coconut milk. Another important dish is\npiri-piri\nchicken, which is grilled chicken basted in\npiri-piri\nsauce and served with fries.\n[\n6\n]\nLike its African neighbors, Mozambique is also blessed with a wide variety of fruits, including citrus produce (such as oranges and grapefruit), bananas, mangoes and coconuts which are enjoyed throughout the nation.\nEntertainment\n[\nedit\n]\nFootball\n(\nPortuguese\n:\nfutebol\n) is the most popular sport in Mozambique. The\nT.V.\nstations watched by Mozambicans are\nTelevis\u00e3o de Mo\u00e7ambique\n,\nYTV\n,\nSTV\n, TIM and\nRTP \u00c1frica\n; Portuguese T.V. stations\nRTP Internacional\n,\nSIC Internacional\n,\nSIC Not\u00edcias\n,\nMTV Portugal\n,\nDisney Channel Portugal\n,\nSuperSport 7\n,\nTSN\n, and\nEuronews\n; and\nBrazilian\nT.V. stations\nTV Globo International\nand\nTV Record\nare also watched on T.V. throughout Mozambique.\nHolidays\n[\nedit\n]\nIndependence Day\n, celebrated on June 25\nNew Year's Day\n, celebrated on January 1\nFamily Day\n, in Mozambique, is celebrated on December 25\nDay of Mozambican Women, celebrated on April 7\nHeroes Day, celebrated on February 3\nRamadan\n, celebrated for the 30 days on changing dates according to the moon calendar (celebrated among Mozambican\nMuslims\n)\nChristmas\n, celebrated on December 25 (celebrated among Mozambican\nChristians\n)\nCultural identity\n[\nedit\n]\nMozambique was ruled by Portugal and they share in common; main language and second main religion (\nRoman Catholicism\n). But since most of the people are\nBantus\n, most of the culture is native and for Bantus living in urban areas with some Portuguese influence. Mozambican culture influences the\nPortuguese culture\n. The\nmusic\n,\nmovies\n(by\nRTP \u00c1frica\n),\nfood\n, and\ntraditions\nare now part of everyday lifestyles of Portugal.\nSpirit possession\n[\nedit\n]\nA new phenomenon of spirit possession appeared after the\nMozambican Civil War\n. These spirits, called\ngamba\n, are identified as dead soldiers, and overwhelmingly possess women. Prior to the war, spirit possession was limited to certain families and was less common.\n[\n7\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency\"\n.\nwww.cia.gov\n.

Although the country is urbanising rapidly, a majority of Namibians still live in rural areas and lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural tradition survive most strongly.\nOne of the\nsparsest populated countries\nin the world, Namibia's different cultures span an impressively diverse population, from the\nBantu-speaking\nOvambo\nand\nHerero tribes\n(the latter of which are admired for their colorful Victorian dress) to the Damara minorities and nomadic\nSan\n.\nGerman colonisation\nleft its own imprint on Namibia, with German being a widely spoken language today and German architecture and cuisine featuring prominently. Namibia's diverse and, at times, harsh climate has contributed to its colourful history.\nPopulation\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nDemographics of Namibia\nNamibia has the second-\nlowest population density\nof any sovereign country, after\nMongolia\n.\n[\n1\n]\nIn 2017 there were on average 3.08 people per km\n2\n.\n[\n2\n]\nThe current population of Namibia is 2,599,944 based on projections of the latest United Nations data.\n[\n3\n]\nEthnic groups\n[\nedit\n]\nNamibia has many ethnic groups. The 9 main ethnic groups are:\nColoured/Baster people\nHerero people\nKavango people\nLozi people\nNama/Damara people\nOvambo people\nSan people\nTswana people\nWhite people\nThese groups can be further broken down into smaller tribes with each having a slightly different dialect from the other.\nLanguage\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLanguages of Namibia\nDuring the\napartheid\nregime in Namibia, the three languages of English, German, and Afrikaans were designated as the official\nlanguages of Namibia\n. After\nNamibia gained independence\nfrom\nSouth Africa\nin 1990, the new government adopted English as the official language, enshrined in the\nconstitution of the country\n. English is now used in government, and it is the medium of instruction in schools and universities. However, the schools of Namibia are facing a shortage of teachers proficient in the English language, and a report reveals that 98% of the country's teachers lack sufficient training in the language.\n[\n4\n]\nThe most widely spoken languages used in households are\nOshiwambo\ndialects, by 49% of the population,\nKhoekhoegowab\nby 11%,\nAfrikaans\nby 10%,\nRuKwangali\nby 9%,\nOtjiherero\nby 9%, and\nSilozi\nby 4.71%.\n[\n5\n]\nOther native languages include the Bantu languages\nSetswana\n,\nGciriku\n,\nFwe\n,\nChikuhane\n,\nMbukushu\n,\nYeyi\n; and the\nKhoisan\nNaro, \u01c3X\u00f3\u00f5,\nKung-Ekoka\n, \u01c2Kx\u02bcau\u01c1\u02bcein and Kxoe.\n[\n6\n]\nEnglish, the\nofficial language\n, is spoken by 3% of people as their native language. Portuguese was spoken by 4\u20135% of the total population, i.e. 100,000 people, made up mostly of the Angolan community in 2014.\n[\n7\n]\nThe number of Angolans in Namibia declined from 2014 to 2015. The economic crisis in the neighboring country affected the numbers.\n[\n8\n]\nAmong the white population, 60% speak Afrikaans, 32% German, 7% English, and 1% Portuguese.\nMain household language\n2001\n[\n9\n]\n2011\n[\n10\n]\nOshiwambo\n48.5\n48.9\nKhoekhoegowab\n11.5\n11.3\nAfrikaans\n11.4\n10.4\nOtjiherero\n7.9\n8.6\nRuKwangali\n9.7\n8.5\nSilozi\n5.0\n4.8\nEnglish\n1.9\n3.4\nGerman\n1.1\n0.9\nSan\nlanguages\n1.2\n0.8\nOther\n1.8\n2.4\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nReligion in Namibia\nNamibian religion is dominated by various branches of\nChristianity\n, with more than 90% of Namibian citizens identifying themselves as Christian. According to the United States\nBureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor\n, in 2007 up to 75% were Protestant, including as much as 50% Lutheran.\n[\n11\n]\nAccording to the Namibia Demographic and Health Survey of 2013, the proportions are:\n[\n12\n]\n65.1% Protestant (43.7% Lutheran, 4.4% Seventh-day Adventist, 17.0% Anglican or other Protestant denomination)\n22.8% Roman Catholic\n10.5% a non-Christian religion (primarily African traditional religions, Sunni Islam, Buddhism)\n1.5% unaffiliated or irreligious\nForeign missionary groups operate in the country. The\nConstitution\nprovides for freedom of religion, and the\ngovernment\ngenerally respects this right in practice.\nIslam in Namibia\nis subscribed to by about 9,000 people,\n[\n13\n]\nmany of them Nama.\n[\n14\n]\nNamibia is home to a\nsmall Jewish community\nof about 100 people.\n[\n15\n]\nNorms and lifestyle\n[\nedit\n]\nDress\n[\nedit\n]\nHerero women in Victorian dresses\nHimba adolescents in northern Namibia, wearing traditional attire. The\nErembe\nheaddress indicates that they are no longer children.\nWomen in different areas of Namibia dress differently from each other. Lozi women wear Musisi or wrap themselves with a\nsarong\ncalled Sitenge. Some women wear traditional clothing while others wear Victorian-styled clothing because of the influence of the missionaries in the area.\n[\n16\n]\nHerero women wear traditional style clothing and dress with traditional jewellery. The hairstyle indicates their rank and social status.\nHimba people\nstill wear traditional attire and apply\notjize\nto their skin, a cosmetic mixture of butterfat and ochre pigment. It gives Himba people's skin and hair plaits a distinctive texture, style, and orange or red tinge, and is often perfumed with aromatic resin.\n[\n17\n]\nGreetings\n[\nedit\n]\nGreetings\nare especially important to Namibians. Namibians tend to be indirect communicators.  Conversations almost always begin with a hello and how are you doing. It is generally considered impolite to just rush into trying to obtain the specific information you need. Extended greetings and handshakes are very important in most Namibian cultures. When food and drink are offered, it is polite to accept. There is a general emphasis on emotional restraint in public, and public displays of affection between spouses or lovers are frowned upon, especially in rural areas.\nAlong with a curtsy, another traditional show of respect is for the greeter to shake with his or her right hand while at the same time touching their right elbow with their left hand. The curtsy and the elbow touch performed together are very common in the northern regions, especially the rural areas. It is considered common courtesy to greet people in. It is considered disrespectful to not greet people. When entering a room for a meeting, you should greet everyone with a\nhandshake\nif possible, before sitting down. When asking someone in a public establishment for help (i.e. directions, prices, etc.), always greet first and ask how they are before proceeding to business. Often after shaking someone's hand, Namibians will continue to hold on to each other's hand while conversing, especially if the two people are friends with one another.\nWhen shaking someone's hand especially when its an elder, males are required to nod their heads while females are required to bend their knees a little bit as a form of respect.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nFamily structure\n[\nedit\n]\nIn Namibia, most households are not\nnuclear families\nbut contain other kin as well. The head of the household manages domestic finances, makes important decisions, and organizes productive activities. Parents receive substantial help with child-rearing from other family members. It is not unusual for children to live with other relatives if the parents have work obligations, the child needs to be closer to school, or a relative needs a child's help. Most boys and girls attend primary school, although sometimes they stay at home to help with the livestock or crops.\nCorporate kin groups are formed by ties traced through women (\nmatrilineal\n), men (\npatrilineal\n), or both (bilateral), depending on ethnicity. These kin groups provide a support network for their members and control joint property, especially livestock; in the past, they also played significant roles in political and religious affairs. There has been a general shift from matrilineal to patrilineal. For example, wives and children in matrilineal communities can now assert rights to the property of deceased husbands and fathers, which has been traditionally inherited by the man's matrilineal relatives (his siblings and sisters' children).\nIn a\nNamibian culture\n, the wealth of a family is measured by how much cattle it has, and families live a semi-nomadic life, following grazing and water sources for their livestock. In the rural communal areas, men and boys generally care for livestock, build and maintain homesteads, plow fields, and contribute some agricultural labor, while women and girls do most of the agricultural labor, food preparation, childcare, and household work.\nMarriage\n[\nedit\n]\nWeddings are extremely important social events in Namibia, bringing family and friends together to sing, dance, and feast. Most weddings combine old and new elements. Many Owambo couples, for example, say their vows in a church ceremony accompanied by identically dressed bridesmaids and groomsmen, then exit to a crowd of guests shouting praises, dancing, and waving horsetail whisks.\nThe\nSouth African\nMarriage Act #25 of 1961 (SA) came into force in Namibia on 1 February 1972 when the\nMarriage Amendment Act, 1970\nwas brought into force in\nSouth West Africa\n. Men and women of full age have the right to marry and to be found a family. They shall be entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during the marriage, and at its dissolution. Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.\n[\n18\n]\nMarriage was allowed without any limitation due to race, color, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, creed, or social or economic status, but not between \"Whites\" and \"Non-Whites\", as defined by the South African government and formalised by the\nProhibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949\n. Only in\n1985 was this restriction repealed\n.\nAccording to the\nBasic Analysis with Highlights\n, July 2003 reflect the incidence of customary and common law marriages in Namibia indicates that About 56% of the Namibian population is never married, with about 19% being married at common law. And about 9% is married traditionally while 7% is married consensually. Some 3% is divorced persons while about 4% are widowed. The highest incidence of married persons are found m the Caprivi (54%), Kunene (48%) and Kavango (61%) regions.\nArts\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nNational Theatre of Namibia\nserves as a venue for both Namibian and foreign musicians and stage actors, in addition to assisting community-based drama groups. School and church groups create and stage less formal productions. Traditional dance troupes representing the various ethnic groups of Namibia perform at local and national festivals and holiday celebrations and also participate in competitions. Many craftspeople produce objects for local use and the tourist trade; wood carvings (containers, furniture, animals) from the Kavango and basketry from Owambo are the best-known examples. Some craftspeople have formed organizations to assist each other with production and marketing.\nNamibia has large numbers of rock art sites scattered across the country, especially rock engraving sites. The best-known rock art areas are the Brandberg Massif in\nDamaraland\n(2697m \u2013 mainly painting sites), and\nTwyfelfontein\n, a UNESCO World Heritage rock art site, also in Damaraland. Both of these sites are in the\nErongo region\nin northwestern Namibia. Another important painting area is the Erongo Mountains southeast of the Brandberg.\nOne of the richest rock painting areas/sites in the subcontinent, the Brandberg has large numbers of sites scattered across its 750\u00a0km\n2\nwhich are mostly the work of ancestral Bushman/San hunter-gatherers and may be up to 2,000 years old or more in some cases. Meanwhile, Twyfelfontein is one of the most important rock engraving sites in southern Africa.\n[\n19\n]\nThe most celebrated rock painting is\nThe White Lady\nrock painting, located on a panel, also depicting other artwork, on a small rock overhang, deep within Brandberg Mountain. The giant granite monolith located in Damaraland and called 'The Brandberg' is Namibia's highest mountain. The painting's German name is Wei\u00dfe Dame\n[\n20\n]\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Namibia\nPopular styles of music in Namibia include\nhip hop\n,\nR&B\n,\nSoul\n,\nreggae\n,\nafro-pop\n,\nhouse\n, and\nkwaito\n. Upon Namibia's independence, Jackson Kaujeua and\nRas Sheehama\nhad been the most outstanding Namibian performers. Kaujeua had been performing since the 1970s, he performed a mix of Namibia's traditional genres with afro-pop/gospel sounds. Other early Namibian musicians include a Setswana band called People's Choice, that was popular between 1996 and 1998 for their hit single \"Don't Look Back (Siwelewele)\", a kwaito trio called Matongo Family, Boli Mootseng, X-Plode with members (Jaicee James, Lizell Swarts & Christi Nomath Warner Warner Christi), Oshiwambo indigenous rapper Shikololo and R&B turn-producer Big Ben. Big Ben has eventually become the most respected artist through his Afro-pop and Fusion with his live shows. In fact, he is one of the very few that performs all his shows with a live band while many still perform with backtracks. Namibian stars such as Stefan Ludik, The Dogg, Gazza, EES, Lady May, Sunny Boy, Sally Boss Madam, and Big Ben have become continental celebrities as well as Placa Gang a group of hard-working dream chasers.\nBlack Vulcanite\n- Mark Mushiva (Mark Question), Allain Villet (alithatdude) and Nikolai Tjongarero (Okin). A Namibian Music Group.\nThe Sanlam-NBC Music Awards and the Namibian Music Awards are two separate institutions that give out annual awards respectively.\n[\n21\n]\nThe Namibia Society of Composers and Authors of Music (NASCAM) has helped promote Namibian music within and outside the country. NAMAS ceremony is run by\nMTC Namibia\nand the\nNamibian Broadcasting Corporation\n. The awards were introduced to replace the Sanlam-NBC Music Awards, which were run by\nSanlam\nNamibia and the Namibian Broadcasting Corporations.\nTraditional Music\nin Namibia is extremely diverse, partly due to the diversity of language groups and the artificial ethnic separation of the past (apartheid), which discouraged people from freely mixing. Namibian musical practices can probably be generalized following three broad (yet culturally mixed) bands across the region. Cultural sharing, migrations, political history, and even agricultural practices are all inscribed upon bodies and revealed in dance and music. Much of the music is sung in groups, mostly with dance and sometimes drums. Most solo songs are either with bows, lamellophones, or unaccompanied.\n[\n22\n]\nTraditional Namibian dances occur at events such as weddings and at traditional festivals such as the Caprivi Arts Festival.\nFolk music\naccompanies storytelling or dancing. The Nama people use various strings, flutes, and drums while the Bantu use xylophones, gourds, and horn trumpets.\n[\n23\n]\nFilm\n[\nedit\n]\nBefore independence, American anthropologist\nJohn Marshall\nmade ethnographic films of the Ju/'hoansi for over four decades from 1950 onwards, resulting in documentary films such as The Hunters (1957) and N\u01c3ai, the Story of a \u01c3Kung Woman (1980).\n[\n24\n]\nAfter independence, Namibian filmmakers have started to assert their own identity. Pioneers included\nBridget Pickering\n,\nRichard Pakleppa\n, and\nCecil Moller\n. They have been joined by a younger generation including\nJoel Haikali\n,\nOshosheni Hiveluah\n,\nPerivi Katjavivi\n,\nTim Huebschle\n,\n[\n25\n]\nand\nKrischka Stoffels\n.\n[\n26\n]\nIn 2000, the Namibian government passed the Namibian Film Commission Act to promote filmmaking in the country.\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nNamibian literature before independence was really more an extension of the South African or German literary scene. After independence, at least initially, there was a movement to publish \"Namibian\" books and create a true \"Namibian literature\". Examples from that period are the works of\nNeshani Andreas\n,\nMvula ya Nangolo\nand\nPeya Mushelenga\n. That impetus has since eased off a bit. Most literature in the indigenous languages consists of traditional tales, short stories, and novels written for schoolchildren. Published fiction, poetry, and autobiographical writings appear in both English and Afrikaans.\n[\n27\n]\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nNamibian cuisine\nKapana stall in\nKatutura\nIn the precolonial period,\nindigenous cuisine\nwas characterized by the use of a very wide range of fruits, nuts, bulbs, leaves, and other products gathered from wild plants and by the hunting of\ngame\n. The domestication of cattle in the region about two thousand years ago by Khoisan groups enabled the use of milk products and the availability of meat. However, during the colonial period, the seizure of communal land in Namibia helped to discourage traditional agriculture and reduced the extent of land available to indigenous people.\nFor agriculturalists, the staple foods are maize, millet and sorghum; for pastoralists, dairy products. Beans and greens are eaten with millet in the north, but otherwise few vegetables are grown or consumed. Hunting and gathering, more important in the past, still provides a dietary supplement for some. Meat is highly desired and eaten. Important occasions are marked by the slaughter of cattle or goats, and the consumption of meat, home-brewed beer, purchased beverages, and other foods. In some cultures, leftover meat is sent home with the guests.\nFood in Namibian cultures:\nMielie meal\nKapana\n, grilled beef strips with hot spices\nOmalodu (Traditional Beer)\nOmbidi (Spinach)\nOshikundu drink\nPearl millet porridge\n(Oshifima)\nRoselle / Mutete\nTripe\n(Also known as Afval, a type of edible lining from the stomachs of various farm animals)\nZambezi bream fish\nSport\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSport in Namibia\nFootball\nis highly popular in Namibia. Most children grow up playing the game.\nTrack and field\nis also a popular sport in the country. Many Namibians run daily chores that demand great physical efforts. Children in rural areas walk or run for long distances daily to reach school. The principal sports in Namibia are\nFootball\n,\nRugby\n,\nCricket\n,\nBoxing\n,\nTrack and field\n. The home stadium for all national teams is the\nIndependence Stadium\nin Windhoek, while\nSam Nujoma Stadium\nin\nKatutura\nis also occasionally used.\nEducation\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nEducation in Namibia\nNamibia has a controversial education history. During the time when the apartheid system was still in effect, it was designed to profit the territory's resident\nWhites\n. When Namibia was able to attain its independence, that was the only time that the government started to provide funding for the natives themselves. There was much improvement in the educational sector when independence was ratified. It was made by the government to be law. It was made compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 16 to attend school in Namibian. The education that they have is provided for by the Namibian government however, the student's parents are to the front for the expenses of the uniforms, textbooks, and miscellaneous fees of the school.  The government also has made provisions to extend education not only to men but also to women.\n[\n28\n]\nThe\nNamibian constitution\nand Education Act (2001)  frame the education system as the following: \"compulsory school attendance exists for the seven years of\nprimary school\n, respectively for children between the age of six ( 6 ) and sixteen (16).  School fees are not allowed for primary education.\" These were six levels of education in Namibia: pre-primary, lower primary (grades 1\u20134), upper primary (grades 5\u20137), junior secondary (grades 8\u201310),\nsenior secondary\n(grades 11 & 12), and tertiary (university) but the curriculum was revised in 2014 and implemented from 2015 .\nThe revised\njunior primary\ncurriculum was implemented in January 2015 while the revised curriculum for the senior primary phase (grades 4\u20137) was implemented in 2016 and implementation of the revised curriculum for the Junior Secondary curriculum was: grade 8 in 2017, grade 9 in 2018. The revised curriculum for the senior secondary Phase for grade 10 was implemented in 2019 and for grade 11 in 2020. In the revised curriculum the\njunior primary\nphase is from Grade 1 to 3 while the senior primary phase is from Grade 4 to 7. The junior secondary phase, which consists of Grade 8 and 9, are required to write junior secondary semi-external examinations at the end of Grade 9 \u2013 similar to what the Grade 10 results were.\nThe\nsenior secondary\nphase starts at Grade 10 and the National Senior Secondary Certificate Ordinary Level (NSSCO) is a two-year course, covered in Grade 10 and 11. Grade 11 is the first exit point in the senior secondary phase. Learners receive an internationally recognized National Senior Secondary Certificate Ordinary.

What is now Niger was created from four distinct cultural areas in the pre-colonial era: the\nDjerma\ndominated\nNiger River\nvalley in the southwest; the northern periphery of\nHausaland\n, made mostly of those states which had resisted the\nSokoto Caliphate\n, and ranged along the long southern border with\nNigeria\n; the\nLake Chad basin\nand\nKaouar\nin the far east, populated by\nKanuri\nfarmers and\nToubou\npastoralists who had once been part of the\nKanem-Bornu Empire\n; and the\nTuareg\nnomads of the\nA\u00efr Mountains\nand\nSaharan\ndesert in the vast north.

Until the 1990s, government and politics was inordinately dominated by\nNiamey\nand the\nDjerma\npeople of the surrounding region. The French had promoted Djerma royalty under their rule. After having first placed their capital in the powerful pre-colonial Hausa state at\nZinder\n, the French moved their administration to what was a small village at Niamey, in part from fear of pan-Hausa power or British imperial designs on southern Niger. This governmental focus on the southwest continued after independence, with political representation reverting to a tiny traditional and educated elite.\n[\n1\n]\nDespite this, only the\nTuareg\nand\nToubou\npastoralists in the sparsely populated north and east have generated movements for autonomy, culminating in rebellions in\n1963\n,\nthe 1990s\n, and\n2007\n.

They are ruled by monarchs, and are famous for their\nBenin Bronzes\n. In the pre-colonial period, they controlled a powerful\nempire\n.\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\nThey are an ethnic group that is primarily found in Edo State, and spread across the Delta, Ondo, and Rivers states of Nigeria in smaller concentrations. The language they speak is called the Edo language. The Bini people are closely related to several other ethnic groups, that usually speak Edo languages, for example the Esan, however it is important to address the fact that the name \"Benin\" (and \"Bini\") is a Portuguese corruption, which came from the word \"Ubinu\", which came into use during the reign of Oba Ewuare the Great, C. 1440. The word \"Ubinu\" was used to depict and portray the royal administrative centre or capital proper of the kingdom, Edo. The word \"Ubinu\" was later corrupted to Bini by a number of mixed ethnicities staying together at the centre, and it was then further corrupted to Benin around the year 1485 at the time when the Portuguese people started making trade relations with Oba Ewuare.\n[\n28\n]\n[\n29\n]\nHausa-Fulani Culture\n[\n30\n]\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHausa-Fulani\nThe Hausa and Fulani ethnic groups are said to be one of the largest ethnic groups in Nigeria, if not the largest, with a population of over 20 million people. The\nHausa\nand\nFulani\nlive in the northern part of Nigeria. They are both different tribes, but are often counted as one due to cultural similarity. The bulk of the Hausa-Fulani population is mainly centered in and around the central of Sokoto, Kano and Katsina, which are said to be important market centers on the southern area of the trans-Saharan caravan trade routes.\nLong before the arrival of the Fulani people, the Hausa had already formed and made well-organised city states; some of these states includes Katsina, Daura, Kano, Zazzau (Zaria), Biram, Gobir and Borno. However, some of these states were conquered, taken over and re-established by the Fulani people which then led to the formation of a few other kingdoms such as Katagum, Hadejia and Gombe. The arrival of the Fulani people into Hausaland brought about great changes in the land, which included the reformation of Islam. This then ended up playing a significant role in the social life and culture of the Hausa people. In education, dress and taste, the Hausa people and their counterparts the Fulani have become a significant part of the Islamic world; this said influence still remains until the current day.\n[\n31\n]\nThe Fulani practice the art of whipping a suitor before giving his bride to him as part of their marriage obligation. This particular obligation has helped to increase the practice of monogamy among themselves, and it is called\nSharo\n.\n[\n32\n]\nThe Fulani people are also nomadic in nature; this nomadic lifestyle spread them into virtually all of West Africa. They are extremely tolerant of the languages of other people around them, leading to the suppression of theirs - especially in northern Nigeria by Hausa.\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nThe Hausas, on the other hand, are said to be very good merchants. This helped spread them to some areas around Nigeria.\n[\n35\n]\nThey have monarchs, are known for celebrating the Hawan Sallah festival,\n[\n36\n]\nand are also followers of the religious teachings of Sheikh\nUsman dan Fodio\n.\n[\n37\n]\nIgbo culture\n[\n38\n]\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nIgbo people\nThe Igbo people, commonly and often referred to as Ibo people, are one of the largest ethnic groups to ever exist in Africa; they have a total population of about 20 million people. Most people who are a part of this ethnic group are based in the southeastern part of Nigeria, they contribute to about 17 percent of the country's population. They can also be found in large numbers in Cameroon and other African countries. It is believed that the Igbo people originated in an area that is about 100 miles north of their current location at the confluence of the Niger and Benue Rivers. The Igbo people share linguistic ties with their neighbours the Bini, Igala, and Idoma, with whom it is believed they were closely related until five to six thousand years ago.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe first Igbo in the region may have moved onto the Awka-Orlu plateau between four and five thousand years ago. The eastern part of Nigeria is the home of the Igbos, who are mostly\nChristians\n.\n[\n39\n]\nTheir traditional religion is known as\nOmenani\n/\nOmenala\n. Both concepts, each an aspect of a single whole, aspire to protect and preserve the purity, sanctity and sacredness of the land and the people therein. 'Omenana' is man-made; it is easily changed and is adaptable. 'Odinana', on the contrary, is a code of life, handed down from Chukwu, God the Creator, to Eri, the patriarch of the Igbo race, to prevent chaos and confusion. The earth spirit, Ana, is 'Odinana', as is the sacred role of yam in the Igbo world, the right of inheritance, and the place of the elder. 'Odinana', as the immutable customary rites and traditions of the Igbo world, is enduring and cuts across indigenous Igbo people, while 'Omenana' is rather relative from one section of the Igbo to the other.\n[\n40\n]\nSocially, the Igbos are led by monarchs who had limited power historically. These figures are expected to confer subordinate titles upon men and women that are highly accomplished. This is known as the\nNze na Ozo\ntitle system.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nCultural exhibition. This can be used to welcome visitors to your home in Igboland, Nigeria\nIjaw culture\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nIjaw people\nThe Ijaw people are said to be a collection of people that are native to the Niger Delta area in Nigeria. Owing to the affinity they have with water, a significant number of the Ijaw people are discovered as migrant fishermen in camps that are as far west as Sierra Leone and as far east as Gabon.\n[\n41\n]\nWith a population of about 4 million, the Ijaws inhabit the Niger Delta section and they make up about 1.8% of Nigeria's population.\n[\n42\n]\nFrom a historical perspective, it is almost impossible to give a precise and accurate account as to when and where the Ijaws originated; numerous different accounts have been given by many historians regarding this issue, but what is certain is that the Ijaws are one of the world's most ancient peoples. The Ijaw people are said by some to be the descendants of the autochthonous people of Africa known as the (H)oru.  The Ijaws were originally known by this name (Oru); at least it was what their immediate neighbours assumed them to be. Although this was a very long time ago, the Ijaws have, however, kept the ancient language and culture of the Orus. Being the first to find a settlement in the Lower Niger and Niger Delta, it is possible that they may have started inhabiting this region as far back as 500 BC.\n[\n43\n]\nLanguage and cultural studies suggest that they are related to the founders of the\nNile Valley\ncivilization complex (and possibly the\nLake Chad\ncomplex).\n[\n44\n]\nThey immigrated to West Africa from the Nile Valley during antiquity. The Ijaw culture of the South has been influenced greatly by its location on the coast and the interaction with foreigners that it necessitated. Its members amassed great wealth while serving as\nmiddlemen\n, and the preponderance of English names among them today is a testament to the\ntrade names\nadopted by their ancestors at this time.\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nYoruba culture\n[\n47\n]\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nYoruba people\nYoruba man in traditional attire.\nThe Yoruba people are said to be one of the three largest ethnic groups in Nigeria, alongside the Igbo and the Hausa-Fulani peoples. They are concentrated in the southwestern section of Nigeria, much smaller and scattered groups of Yoruba people live in Benin and northern Togo and they are numbered to be more than 20 million at the turn of the 21st century.\n[\n48\n]\nThe Yoruba people have always shared a common language called the Yoruba language and have had the same culture for hundreds of years now, but historically they were less likely to be a single political unit prior to the colonial period.\n[\n49\n]\nThe Yoruba people are believed to have migrated from the east to their present lands west of the lower Niger River more than a millennium ago.\n[\n50\n]\nThey eventually became the most urbanized Africans of precolonial times. The Yoruba people eventually formed many kingdoms of various sizes, each of which was centered on a capital city or town and was ruled by a hereditary king known as an O\nba\n. Their towns eventually became more and more populated and grew into the present-day cities of Oyo, Ile-Ife, Ilesha, Ibadan, Ilorin, Ijebu-Ode, Ikere-Ekiti, and others.\n[\n51\n]\nOyo developed in the medieval and early modern periods into the largest of the Yoruba kingdoms, while Ile-Ife still remained a town of very strong religious significance as the site of the earth's creation according to Yoruba mythology.\n[\n52\n]\nOyo and the other kingdoms declined in the late 18th and 19th centuries owing to disputes among minor Yoruba rulers and invasions by the Fon of Dahomey (now Benin Republic) and the Muslim Fulani. The traditional Yoruba kingships still survive, but with only a hint of their former political power. These monarchs have titled individuals that serve beneath them, with most of this latter group making up the membership of the\nOgboni\nsecret society. Their traditional religion,\nIfa\n, has been recognized by\nUNESCO\nas a\nmasterpiece of the oral tradition of Humanity\n.\n[\n53\n]\nNigerian upper class\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nNigerian Chieftaincy\nSee also:\nSocial class in Nigeria\nChief\nOlusegun Obasanjo\nAlhaji\nUmaru Musa Yar'Adua\nDr.\nGoodluck Jonathan\nGeneral\nMuhammadu Buhari\nChief\nBola Tinubu\nPresidents of Nigeria's\ncurrent republic\n,\nall of whom have been titled chiefs of various ethnic groups\n.\nEver since the country's earliest centralization - under the\nNokites\nat a time contemporaneous to the birth of\nJesus Christ\n- Nigeria has been ruled by a class of titled potentates that are known as\nchiefs\n.\n[\n54\n]\nLed by the\nNigerian traditional rulers\n(i.e. monarchs who have received definite authority from the official government and are recognized by the laws of Nigeria),\n[\n55\n]\nthe chiefs come in various ranks and are of varied kinds - some monarchs are so powerful that they influence political and religious life outside their immediate domains (the\nSultan of Sokoto\nand the\nOoni of Ife\n, for example), while in contrast many local families around the country install their eldest members as\ntitled chiefs\nin order for them to provide them with what is an essentially titular leadership.\n[\n56\n]\nAlthough chiefs have few official powers today, they are widely respected, and prominent monarchs are often courted to endorse politicians during elections in the hopes of them conferring legitimacy to their campaigns by way of doing so. Successful Nigerians, such as businessmen and the said politicians, typically themselves aspire to the holding of chieftaincies, and the monarchs' control of the honours system that provides them serves as an important royal asset.\n[\n57\n]\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nNigerian literature\nChinua Achebe\n, a\nBooker prize\n-winning author.\nWole Soyinka\n, a\nNobel Laureate in Literature\n.\nNigeria is famous for its\nEnglish language\nliterature\n.\nThings Fall Apart\n,\n[\n58\n]\nby\nChinua Achebe\n, is an important book in\nAfrican literature\n.\n[\n59\n]\nWith over eight million copies sold worldwide, it has been translated into 50 languages, making Achebe the most translated African writer of all time.\n[\n60\n]\n[\n61\n]\nNigerian Nobel laureate\n[\n62\n]\n\u2014\nWole Soyinka\n[\n63\n]\ndescribed the work as \"the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of the African character, rather than portraying the African as an exotic, as the white man would see him.\"\n[\n64\n]\nNigeria has other notable writers of English language literature.

People in urban regions of Nigeria dress in western style, the youth mainly wearing jeans and T-shirts.  Other Nigerian men and women typically wear a traditional style called\nBuba\n. For men the loose-fitting shirt goes down to halfway down the thigh. For women, the loose-fitting blouse goes down a little below the waist. Other clothing gear includes a\ngele\n, which is the woman's headgear. For men their traditional cap is called\nfila\n.\nHistorically, Nigerian fashion incorporated many different types of fabrics. Cotton has been used for over 500 years for fabric-making in Nigeria. Silk (called\ntsamiya\nin\nHausa\n,\nsanyan\nin\nYoruba\n, and\nakpa-obubu\nin\nIgbo\n) is also used.\n[\n83\n]\nPerhaps the most popular fabric used in Nigerian fashion is Dutch wax print, produced in the Netherlands. The import market for this fabric is dominated by the Dutch company Vlisco,\n[\n84\n]\nwhich has been selling its Dutch wax print fabric to Nigerians since the late 1800s, when the fabric was sold along the company's oceanic trading route to Indonesia. Since then, Nigerian and African patterns, colour schemes, and motifs have been incorporated into Vlisco's designs to become a staple of the brand.\n[\n85\n]\nNigeria has over 250 ethnic groups\n[\n86\n]\nand as a result, a wide variety of traditional clothing styles. In the Yoruba tradition, women wear an\niro\n(wrapper),\nbuba\n(loose shirt) and\ngele\n(head-wrap).\n[\n87\n]\nThe men wear\nbuba\n(long shirt),\nsokoto\n(baggy trousers),\nagbada\n(flowing robe with wide sleeves) and\nfila\n(a hat).\n[\n88\n]\nIn the Igbo tradition, the men's cultural attire is\nIsiagu\n(a patterned shirt), which is worn with trousers and the traditional Igbo men's hat called\nOkpu Agwu\n. The women wear a puffed sleeved blouse, two wrappers and a headwrap.\n[\n89\n]\nHausa men wear\nbarbarigas\nor\nkaftans\n(long flowing gowns) with tall decorated hats. The women wear wrappers and shirts and cover their heads with\nhijabs\n(veils).\n[\n90\n]\nOral tradition\n[\nedit\n]\nOral traditions\nin\nNigeria\nare part of a form of human communication in which knowledge, art ideas, and\ncultural\nmaterials are acquired, conserved, and conveyed orally from one\ngeneration\nto another.\n[\n91\n]\nIt is one of the earliest works from Nigeria put into writing and entails several\ngenres\nof indigenous knowledge production communicated to its adherents verbally.\n[\n92\n]\nIt also encompasses the transmission of historical and artistic information from an initial witness through generation (the information is handled by skilled oral historians).\nTraditions have evolved along with the societies and cultures that produced them. Oral traditions in Nigeria have played a very important role in preserving and transmitting historical information and its various functions. Historical information is usually transmitted through speech, songs, folktales, prose, chants, and ballads. Oral traditions in Nigeria are commonly used as a means of keeping the past alive.\n[\n93\n]\n[\n94\n]\nUniversity culture in Nigeria\n[\nedit\n]\nNigerian\nuniversity\nculture\nencompasses a tapestry of academic pursuit, social engagement, and cultural diversity.\n[\n95\n]\nRenowned for its rigorous academic standards, Nigerian university institutions provide an academic environment where students are challenged to excel in different academic fields.

Students raise concerns and demand accountability from those in positions of power through these methods.                                                                                   One of the most known traditional markers of Nigerian university culture is the sign-out day tradition, which is an annual tradition observed in Nigerian universities.\n[\n105\n]\nSign-out day is a day for celebrating the last day of the final year session by wearing white clothing. The tradition is celebrated with a white T-shirt or any white shirt worn by a graduating student. The shirts are then to be signed by friends and well-wishers.\n[\n106\n]\nThis tradition marks the culmination of academic studies for graduating students.\n[\n107\n]\nFor university students, this ceremonial event holds significant cultural and social importance within the Nigerian higher education system, symbolizing the completion of undergraduate studies and the transition to the next phase of life.\n[\n108\n]\nDespite the numerous challenges facing Nigerian universities, including inadequate funding,\nviolent cult-related confraternities\n, infrastructure deficiencies, and the occasional strikes, students navigate these obstacles with a different array of resolve, driven by their thirst for a better future.\n[\n109\n]\n[\n110\n]\n[\n111\n]\nFurthermore, the cultural diversity of Nigeria, with its myriad ethnic groups, languages, and traditions, is vividly reflected on university campuses.\n[\n112\n]\nStudents from diverse backgrounds come together, sharing their unique perspectives and experiences, and enriching the academic and social fabric of the Nigerian university community.\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nNigeria portal\nSociety portal\nArchitecture of Nigeria\nFestivals in Nigeria\nGender roles and fluidity in indigenous Nigerian cultures\nList of museums in Nigeria\nMusic of Nigeria\nNok culture\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nNwafor (11 August 2022).\n\"Nigerian cultural values are under threat, Toyin Falola, US scholar, warns\"\n.\nVanguard News\n.

Rwandan staples include\nbananas\n,\nplantains\n(known as\nibitoke\n),\npulses\n,\nsweet potatoes\n,\nbeans\n, and\ncassava\n(manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat\nmeat\nmore than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish,\ntilapia\nis popular.\n[\n7\n]\nThe\npotato\n, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian\ncolonialists\n, became very popular.\n[\n8\n]\nUgali\n(or\nubugali\n) is a paste made from cassava or\nmaize\nand water, to form a\nporridge\n-like consistency that is eaten throughout East Africa.\n[\n9\n]\nIsombe\nis made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish.\n[\n8\n]\nLunch is usually a\nbuffet\nknown as\nmelange\n, consisting of the above staples and possibly meat.\nBrochette\nis the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from\ngoat\n, but sometimes\ntripe\n,\nbeef\n,\npork\nor\nfish\n.\n[\n10\n]\nIn rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and\nslaughtering\nthe goats, skewering and\nbarbecuing\nthe meat, and serving it with grilled bananas.\n[\n11\n]\nMilk\n, particularly in a fermented form called\nikivuguto\n, is a common drink throughout the country.\n[\n12\n]\nOther drinks include a traditional beer called\nurwagwa\n, made from\nsorghum\nor bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies.\n[\n8\n]\nCommercial beers brewed in Rwanda include\nPrimus\n,\nM\u00fctzig\n, and\nAmstel\n.\n[\n9\n]\nArts and crafts\n[\nedit\n]\nPaintings on display in\nKigali\nBottle,\nTswa people\n, Rwanda, early 20th century\nMain article:\nArt in Rwanda\nTraditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country, although most originated as functional items rather than purely for decoration.\n[\n13\n]\nWoven baskets and bowls are especially common.\n[\n14\n]\nThe south east of Rwanda is noted for\nimigongo\n, a unique cow dung art, whose history dates back to when the region was part of the independent\nGisaka\nkingdom.

The Sultanates of\nAdal\nand\nMogadishu\nwere vibrant hubs of trade, knowledge and culture whose globetrotting merchants and longstanding diasporic communities exchanged goods and ideas across the\nIndian Ocean\n. This cosmopolitan legacy is reflected in Somalia\u2019s rich oral heritage, expressed through poetry, song, and proverbs celebrated for their wit and eloquence.\n[\n8\n]\nMoreover, a keen sense of humor and wit, combined with physical courage and mental acuity, is demonstrated in traditional games such as \u201cgoogaleysi,\u201d which both entertain and impart practical knowledge. Today,\nSomalia\nand its global diaspora continue to contribute to business, fashion, music, trade, and science and technology.\n[\n9\n]\nThe cultural diffusion of\nSomali commercial enterprise\ncan be detected in its exotic\ncuisine\n, which contains Southeast Asian influences. Due to the Somali people's foremost ingenuity and facility with poetry, Somalia has often been referred to as a \"Nation of Poets\" and a \"Nation of\nBards\n\", as, for example, by the\nCanadian\nnovelist\nMargaret Laurence\n.\n[\n10\n]\nSomalis have a story-telling tradition.\nAccording to Canadian novelist and scholar\nMargaret Laurence\n, who originally coined the term \"Nation of Poets\" to describe the Somali Peninsular, the\nEidagale\nclan were viewed as \"the recognized experts in the composition of poetry\" by their fellow Somali contemporaries:\nAmong the tribes, the Eidagalla are the recognized experts in the composition of poetry. One individual poet of the Eidagalla may be no better than a good poet of another tribe, but the Eidagalla appear to have more poets than any other tribe. \"if you had a hundred Eidagalla men here,\" Hersi Jama once told me, \"And asked which of them could sing his own gabei ninety-five would be able to sing. The others would still be learning.\"\n[\n11\n]\nSomalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional\nSomali folklore\n. Most Somali songs are\npentatonic\n; that is, they only use five\npitches\nper\noctave\nin contrast to a\nheptatonic\n(seven note) scale such as the\nmajor scale\n.\nSomali art is the artistic culture of the Somali people, both historic and contemporary. These include artistic traditions in\npottery\n,\nmusic\n,\narchitecture\n,\nwood carving\nand other genres. Somali art is characterized by its\naniconism\n, partly as a result of the vestigial influence of the pre-Islamic\nmythology\nof the Somalis coupled with their ubiquitous\nMuslim\nbeliefs. The country's shape gives a united country the nickname\ntoddobo\n(seven).\n[\n12\n]\nPan-Somalism\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSomali nationalism\nSomali nationalism\n(\nSomali\n:\nSoomaalinimo\n) is centered on the notion that the\nSomali people\nshare a common language, religion, culture and ethnicity, and as such constitute a nation unto themselves. The ideology's earliest manifestations in the medieval era are traced to the\nAdalites\nwhilst in the contemporary era its often traced back to SYL or in present-day\nSomaliland\n, the first Somali nationalist political organization to be formed was the\nSomali National League\n(SNL), established in 1935 in the former\nBritish Somaliland\nprotectorate. In the country's northeastern, central and southern regions, the similarly oriented\nSomali Youth Club\n(SYC) was founded in 1943 in\nItalian Somaliland\n, just prior to the\ntrusteeship period\n.

Islam may thus have been introduced into Somalia well before the faith even took root in its place of origin.\n[\n16\n]\nAn alternate theory states that Islam was brought to the coastal settlements of Somalia between the 7th and the 10th century by seafaring Arab and Persian merchants.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n16\n]\nSomali Sufi religious orders (\ntariqa\n) \u2013 the\nQadiriyya\n, the Ahmadiya and the\nSalihiyya\n\u2013 in the form of Muslim brotherhoods have played a major role in Somali Islam and the modern era history of Somalia.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\nOf the three orders, the less strict Qaadiriya\ntariqa\nis the oldest, and it is the sect to which most Somalis belong.\n[\n20\n]\nThe Qaadiriya order is named after Shaikh\nMuhiuddin Abdul Qadir Gilani\nof Baghdad.\n[\n21\n]\nI. M. Lewis\nstates that Qaadiriya has a high reputation for maintaining a higher standard of Islamic instruction than its rivals.\n[\n22\n]\nAhmadiyah and its sub-sect Salihiyyah preached a puritanical form of Islam,\n[\n20\n]\nand have rejected the popular Sufi practice of\ntawassul\n(visiting the tombs of saints to ask mediation). B. G. Martin states that these two orders shared some of the views of the\nWahhabis\nof Arabia.\n[\n23\n]\nThe religious differences between Qaadiriya and Salihiyya were controversial, as Salihis continued to oppose the Qadiris' practice of\ntawassul\n, and claimed the act to be invalid and improper religious activity.\n[\n23\n]\nThe Ahmadiya has the smallest number of adherents of the three orders.\n[\n18\n]\nMerca\nis an ancient\nIslamic\ncenter in\nSomalia\n.\nQur'anic schools\n(also known as\ndugsi\n) remain the basic system of traditional religious instruction in Somalia. It is delivered in Arabic. They provide Islamic education for children. According to the\nUNICEF\n, the\ndugsi\nsystem where the content is based on\nQuran\n, teaches the greatest number of students and enjoys high parental support, is oftentimes the only system accessible to Somalis in nomadic as compared to urban areas.\n[\n24\n]\nA study from 1993 found, among other things, that \"unlike in primary schools where gender disparity is enormous, around 40 per cent of Qur'anic school pupils are girls; but the teaching staff have minimum or no qualification necessary to ensure intellectual development of children.\" To address these concerns, the Somali government on its own part subsequently established the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs, under which Qur'anic education is now regulated.\n[\n25\n]\nThe Somali community has produced important Muslim figures over the centuries, many of whom have significantly shaped the course of Islamic learning and practice in the\nHorn of Africa\nand the\nMuslim world\n.\nMosque\nin\nBorama\n,\nSomaliland\nAlthough\nPew Research Center\nhas not conducted a survey in Somalia, its Somali-majority northwestern neighbour Djibouti reported a creed breakdown of Muslims which was reported as 77% adhering to\nSunnism\n, 8% as\nnon-denominational Muslim\n, 2% as\nShia\n, thirteen percent refusing to answer, and a further report inclusive of\nSomali Region\nstipulating 2% adherence to a minority sect (e.g.\nIbadism\n,\nQuranism\netc.).\n[\n26\n]\nSomali Sunnis primarily belong to\nShafi`i\nschool of\nIslamic jurisprudence\n,\n[\n15\n]\nor are adherents to the\nSalafi\ncreed.\n[\n27\n]\nSufism\n, the mystical dimension of Islam, is also well-established, with many local\njama'a\n(\nzawiya\n) or congregations of the various\ntariiqa\nor Sufi orders.\n[\n28\n]\nThe\nconstitution\nof Somalia likewise defines Islam as the religion of the Somali Republic, and Islamic\nSharia\nas the basic source for national legislation.\n[\n29\n]\nAlthough Somali women were initially excluded from the many male-dominated religious orders, the all-female institution\nAbay Siti\nwas formed in the late 19th century, incorporating Somali tradition and Islam.\nIn addition, the Somali community has produced numerous important Islamic figures over the centuries, many of whom have significantly shaped the course of Muslim learning and practice in the Horn of Africa, the\nArabian Peninsula\n, and well beyond.

It is a member of the\nCushitic\nbranch of the\nAfro-Asiatic\nlanguage family, and its nearest relatives are the\nAfar\nand\nsaho\nlanguages. Somali is the best documented of the Cushitic languages,\n[\n30\n]\nwith academic studies of it dating from before 1900.\nThe\nOsmanya\nwriting script.\nSomali dialects are divided into three main groups: Northern, Benaadir and\nMaay\n. Northern Somali (or Northern-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali. Benaadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the\nBenadir\ncoast from\nAdale\nto south of\nMerca\n, including\nMogadishu\n, as well as in the immediate hinterland. The coastal dialects have additional\nphonemes\nwhich do not exist in Standard Somali. Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle (\nRahanweyn\n) clans in the southern areas of Somalia.\nSince Somali had long lost its ancient script,\n[\n31\n]\na number of\nwriting systems\nhave been used over the years for transcribing the language. Of these, the\nSomali alphabet\nis the most widely used, and has been the official writing script in Somalia since the government of former President of Somalia Siad Barre formally introduced it in October 1972.\n[\n32\n]\nThe script was developed by a number of leading scholars of\nSomali\n, including\nMusa Haji Ismail Galal\n,\nB.

It is now most frequently heard among older generations who were in contact with the Italians at that time or later as migrants into Italy.

This attire is no longer common though it can be found in some rural communities.\nWomen\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nWomen in Somalia\nSomali women in traditional\ndirac\nand\nshash\nSomali women basket weaving\nDuring regular, day-to-day activities, women usually wear the\nguntiino\n, a long stretch of cloth tied over the shoulder and draped around the waist. The guntiino is traditionally made out of plain white fabric sometimes featuring with decorative borders, although nowadays alindi, a textile common in the Horn region and some parts of North Africa, is more frequently used. The garment can be worn in many different styles and with different fabrics.\nFor more formal settings such as weddings or religious celebrations like\nEid\n, women wear the dirac, a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of cotton or polyester fabric. It is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere. Known as the gorgorad, the underskirt is made out of\nsilk\nand serves as a key part of the overall outfit. The dirac is usually sparkly and very colorful, the most popular styles being those with gilded borders or threads. The fabric is typically acquired from Somali clothing stores in tandem with the\ngorgorad\n. In more informal settings, like being at home, Somali women typically wear baati. A baati is a long dress-like wear that is made out of comfortable polyester.\nMarried women tend to sport\nhead-scarves\nreferred to as\nshash\n, and also often cover their upper body with a\nshawl\nknown as\ngarbasaar\n. A garbasaar can be worn by any woman regardless of their marital status. In general, however, Somali women cover up with hijab when outside their home or in the presence of men outside of the immediate family (cousins, uncles, friends).\nAdditionally, Somali women have a long tradition of wearing gold and silver jewelry, particularly bangles. During weddings, the bride is frequently adorned in gold. Many Somali women by tradition also wear gold necklaces and anklets. The\nxirsi\n, an Islamic necklace likewise donned in Ethiopia and Yemen, is frequently worn.\nArt\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSomali art\nSomali women performing a traditional dance\nSomali singer\nFartuun Birimo\nwearing\nhenna\nhand and arm designs.\nSomali art is the artistic culture of the Somali people, both historic and contemporary. These include artistic traditions in\npottery\n, music, architecture,\nwood carving\nand other genres. Somali art is characterized by its\naniconism\n, partly as a result of the vestigial influence of the pre-Islamic\nmythology\nof the Somalis coupled with their ubiquitous\nMuslim\nbeliefs. However, there have been instances in the past of artistic depictions representing living creatures such as the golden birds on the Mogadishan\ncanopies\n, the\ncamels\nand\nhorses\non the ancient\nrock paintings\nin northern Somalia, and the\nplant decorations\non religious\ntombs\nin southern Somalia, but these are considered rare. Instead, intricate patterns and geometric designs, bold colors and monumental architecture were the norm.\nAdditionally,\nhenna\nis an important part of Somali culture. It is worn by Somali women on their hands, arms, feet and neck during weddings, Eid,\nRamadan\n, and other festive occasions. Somali henna designs are similar to other horn of Africans, often featuring flower motifs and triangular shapes. The palm is also frequently decorated with a dot of henna, and the fingertips are dipped in the dye. Henna parties are usually held before the wedding ceremony takes place.\nCustoms and courtesies\n[\nedit\n]\nSomali woman building a Somali house\nSomalis warmly greet each other with handshakes, but shaking hands with the opposite sex is avoided by many. Common verbal greetings include:\nSomali woman in\nHargeisa\nopening speech with traditional greeting.\nA Somali woman showing a decorated pottery\nCommon Verbal Phrases include;\nAssalamu aleikum\n(Peace be upon you)\nMaalin wanaagsan\n(\ngood day/morning\n)\nGalab wanaagsan\n(\ngood afternoon\n)\nHabeen wanaagsan\n(\ngood night\n)\nIska warran\nand\nIi waran\n(How are you?)\nNabad\n(I'm fine or literally translated meaning (\npeace\n)\nSomalis use sweeping hand and arm gestures to dramatize speech. Many ideas are expressed through specific hand gestures. Most of these gestures are performed by women:\nA swift twist of the open hand means \"nothing\" or \"no\".\nSnapping fingers may mean \"long ago\" or and \"so on\"\nA thumb under the chin indicates \"fullness\".\nIt is impolite to point the sole of one's foot or shoe at another person.\nIt is impolite to use the index finger to call somebody; that gesture is used for calling dogs.\nDuring the Siad Barre era, a new greeting intended to combat the prevalence of\nclannism\nwas introduced called\njaale\n, which in Somali has dual meanings, including the color\nyellow\nand\ncomrade\nor\nfriend\n.\n[\n52\n]\nMedia\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMedia of Somalia\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSomali literature\nSomali language\nbooks on display.\nSomali scholars have for centuries produced many notable examples of\nIslamic literature\nranging from poetry to\nHadith\n. With the adoption of the\nLatin alphabet\nin 1972 to transcribe the Somali language, numerous contemporary Somali authors have also released novels, some of which have gone on to receive worldwide acclaim. Of these modern writers,\nNuruddin Farah\nis probably the most celebrated. Books such as\nFrom a Crooked Rib\nand\nLinks\nare considered important literary achievements, works which have earned Farah, among other accolades, the 1998\nNeustadt International Prize for Literature\n.\nFarah Mohamed Jama Awl\nis another prominent Somali writer who is perhaps best known for his Dervish era novel,\nIgnorance is the enemy of love\n.\nMohamed Ibrahim Warsame\nis considered by many to be the greatest living Somali poet, and several of his works have been translated internationally.\nSport\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSports in Somalia\nFootball\n, or soccer, is the most popular sport in Somalia. Important domestic competitions are the\nSomalia League\nand\nSomalia Cup\n, with the\nSomalia national football team\nplaying internationally.\nBasketball\nis also played in the country. The\nFIBA Africa Championship 1981\nwas hosted in Mogadishu from December 15 to December 23, 1981, during which the\nnational basketball team\nreceived the bronze medal.\nAbdi Bile\nwas the first athlete from Somalia to win a gold medal at the\nIAAF World Championships in Athletics\nwhen he became 1500 metre champion at the\n1987 World Championships\n.\nMo Farah\nhas also won three World Championship golds and two Olympic golds at the\n2012 London Olympics\nin the 5000 and 10,000 metres.\nIn the\nmartial arts\n,\nFaisal Jeylani Aweys\nand Mohamed Deq Abdulle took home a silver medal and fourth place, respectively, at the 2013 Open World\nTaekwondo\nChallenge Cup in\nTongeren\n.

Dating from 75,000 years ago, these small drilled snail shells could have no other function than to have been strung on a string as a necklace. South Africa was one of the cradles of the human species. One of the defining characteristics of the human species is the creation of art (from Latin \"ars\", meaning worked or formed from basic material).\nThe scattered tribes of\nKhoisan\npeoples moving into South Africa from around 10,000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings. They were superseded by\nBantu\nand\nNguni\npeoples with their own vocabularies of art forms. In the 20th century, traditional tribal forms of art were scattered and re-melded by the divisive policies of\napartheid\n.\nNew great forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. The Dutch-influenced folk art of the\nAfrikaner\nTrekboer\nand the urban white artists earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards also contributed to this eclectic mix, which continues to evolve today.\nOne form of art developed during the period of apartheid. This new characterisation was termed \"\ntownship\nart\" and became common in the 1960s and 1970s. This art style tended to depict scenes from everyday life of poor black individuals in South Africa.\n[\n8\n]\nCommon visual elements in this art style are dilapidated houses, women washing clothes, penny whistlers, and black mother-and-child tableaux.\nOracles of the Pink Universe\nby\nSimphiwe Ndzube\n, 2021\nContemporary South Africa has a vibrant art scene, with artists receiving international recognition. The recent \"Figures and Fictions\" exhibition of South African photography at the\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nin London included the work of\nMikhael Subotzky\n,\nZanele Muholi\n,\nDavid Goldblatt\n,\nZwelethu Mthethwa\nand\nGuy Tillim\n. Contemporary South African artists whose work has been met with international acclaim include\nMarlene Dumas\n,\nWilliam Kentridge\nand John Smith.\nArchitecture\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nArchitecture of Johannesburg\nand\nCape Dutch architecture\nOld Dutch\nchurch in\nLadismith\nThe\narchitecture of South Africa\nmirrors the vast ethnic and cultural diversity of the country and its historical colonial period. In addition, influences from other distant countries have contributed to the variety of the South African architectural landscape.\nHerbert Baker\n, among the country's most influential architects, designed the\nUnion Buildings\nin\nPretoria\n. Other buildings of note include the\nRhodes memorial\nand\nSt George's Cathedral\nin\nCape Town\n, and\nSt John's College\nin\nJohannesburg\n.\nGateway to the\nCastle of Good Hope\n, the oldest building in South Africa\nCape Dutch architecture\nwas prominent in the early days (17th century) of the\nCape Colony\n, and the name derives from the fact that the initial settlers of the Cape were primarily Dutch. The style has roots in medieval Holland, Germany, France and Indonesia. Houses in this style have a distinctive and recognisable design, with a prominent feature being the grand, ornately rounded gables, reminiscent of features in townhouses of\nAmsterdam\nbuilt in the\nDutch style\n.\nThe rural landscape of South Africa is populated with traditional and European-influenced\nAfrican architecture\n.\nCinema\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nCinema of South Africa\nWhile many foreign films have been produced about South Africa (usually involving race relations), few local productions are known outside South Africa itself. One exception was the film\nThe Gods Must Be Crazy\nin 1980, set in the\nKalahari\n. This is about how life in a traditional community of\nSan\n(Bushmen) is changed when a\nCoke\nbottle, thrown out of a plane, suddenly lands from the sky. The late\nJamie Uys\n, who wrote and directed\nThe Gods Must Be Crazy\n, also had success overseas in the 1970s with his films\nFunny People\nand\nFunny People II\n, similar to the TV series\nCandid Camera\nin the US.\nLeon Schuster\n's\nYou Must Be Joking!\nfilms are in the same genre, and hugely popular among South Africans. Schuster's most successful film internationally is\nMr Bones\n, which was also the best performing film locally at the time of its release, grossing 35m USD.\n[\n9\n]\nThis was surpassed by the sequel,\nMr Bones 2: Back from the Past\n.\nThe most high-profile film portraying South Africa in recent years was\nDistrict 9\n. Directed by\nNeill Blomkamp\n, a native South African, and produced by\nPeter Jackson\n, the action/science-fiction film depicts a sub-class of alien refugees forced to live in the slums of\nJohannesburg\nin what many saw as a creative allegory for\napartheid\n. The film was a critical and commercial success worldwide, and was nominated for Best Picture at the\n82nd Academy Awards\n. Another notable film that was produced in South Africa is\nChappie\n.\nOther notable exceptions are the film\nTsotsi\n, which won the\nAcademy Award for Foreign Language Film\nat the\n78th Academy Awards\nin 2006 as well as\nU-Carmen eKhayelitsha\n, which won the\nGolden Bear\nat the 2005\nBerlin International Film Festival\n.\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLiterature of South Africa\nOlive Schreiner\n, the author of\nThe Story of an African Farm\n(1883)\nThere are 11 national languages in South Africa. South Africa's unique social and political history has generated a rich variety of literatures, with themes spanning pre-colonial life, the days of apartheid, and the lives of people in the \"new South Africa\".\nMany of the first black South African print authors were missionary-educated, and many wrote in either English or\nAfrikaans\n. One of the first well known novels written by a black author in an African language was\nSolomon Thekiso Plaatje\n's\nMhudi\n, written in 1930.\nNotable white English-language South African authors include\nNadine Gordimer\nwho was, in\nSeamus Heaney\n's words, one of \"the guerrillas of the imagination\", and who became the first South African and the seventh woman to be awarded the\nNobel Prize for Literature\nin 1991. Her novel,\nJuly's People\n, was released in 1981, depicting the collapse of white-minority rule.\nAthol Fugard\n, whose plays have been regularly premiered in\nfringe theatres\nin South Africa, London (The\nRoyal Court Theatre\n), and New York City.\nOlive Schreiner\n's\nThe Story of an African Farm\n(1883) was a revelation in Victorian literature: it is heralded by many as introducing feminism into the novel form.\nAlan Paton\npublished the acclaimed novel\nCry, the Beloved Country\nin 1948. He told the tale of a black priest who comes to\nJohannesburg\nto find his son, which became an international best-seller. During the 1950s,\nDrum\nmagazine became a hotbed of political satire, fiction, and essays, giving a voice to urban black culture.\nAfrikaans-language writers also began to write controversial material.\nBreyten Breytenbach\nwas jailed for his involvement with the guerrilla movement against apartheid.\nAndre Brink\nwas the first\nAfrikaner\nwriter to be\nbanned\nby the government after he released the novel\nA Dry White Season\nabout a white South African who discovers the truth about a black friend who dies in police custody.\nJohn Maxwell (JM) Coetzee\nwas also first published in the 1970s, and became internationally recognise in 1983 with his\nBooker Prize\n-winning novel\nLife & Times of Michael K\n. His 1999 novel\nDisgrace\nwon him his second\nBooker Prize\nas well as the 2000\nCommonwealth Writers' Prize\n. He is also the recipient of the\nNobel Prize for Literature\nin 2003.\nEnglish writer\nJ. R. R. Tolkien\n, author of\nThe Hobbit\n,\nThe Lord of the Rings\nand\nThe Silmarillion\n, was born in\nBloemfontein\nin 1892.\nPoetry\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSouth African poetry\nSouth Africa has a rich tradition of\noral poetry\n. Several influential African poets became prominent in the 1970s such as\nMongane Wally Serote\n, whose most famous work,\nNo Baby Must Weep\n, gave insight into the everyday lives of black South Africans under apartheid. Another famous black novelist,\nZakes Mda\n, transitioned from poetry and plays to becoming a novelist in the same time period. His novel,\nThe Heart of Redness\nwon the 2001\nCommonwealth Writers Prize\nand was made a part of the school curriculum across South Africa.\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of South Africa\nEnoch Sontonga\nThere is great diversity in music from South Africa. Many black musicians who sang in Afrikaans or English during apartheid have since begun to sing in traditional African languages, and have developed unique styles called\nKwaito\nand\nAmapiano\n. Of note is\nBrenda Fassie\n, who launched to fame with her song \"Weekend Special\", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include\nLadysmith Black Mambazo\n, while the\nSoweto String Quartet\nperforms classic music with an African flavour. White and Coloured South African singers are historically influenced by European musical styles.\nSouth Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably\nHugh Masekela\n,\nJonas Gwangwa\n,\nAbdullah Ibrahim\n,\nMiriam Makeba\n,\nJonathan Butler\n,\nChris McGregor\n, and\nSathima Bea Benjamin\n. Afrikaans music covers multiple genres, such as the\ncontemporary\nSteve Hofmeyr\nand the\npunk rock\nband\nFokofpolisiekar\n. Crossover artists such as Verity (internationally recognised for innovation in the music industry) and\nJohnny Clegg\nand his bands\nJuluka\nand\nSavuka\nhave enjoyed various success underground, publicly, and abroad. Don Clarke who wrote\nSanbonani\n,\n[\n10\n]\na local hit for\nPJ Powers\n, and Hotline in 1986 wrote much of the music for\nLeon Schuster\n's films including\nTill You're Free Again\n[\n11\n]\nwhich he recorded for the film\nFrank and Fearless\nin 2018. Rap-rave group\nDie Antwoord\nhave also found international success.\nThe South African music scene includes\nKwaito\nand\nAmapiano\n, new music genres that had developed in the mid-1980s and late 2010s, and have since developed to become a popular socio-economic form of representation among the populace. However, some argue that the political aspects of Kwaito have since diminished after Apartheid, and the relative interest in politics has become a very minor aspect of daily life. Others argue that in a sense, Kwaito is in fact a political force that shows activism in its apolitical actions.\nToday, major corporations like\nSony\n,\nBMG\n, and\nEMI\nhave appeared on the South African scene to produce and distribute Kwaito music. Due to its popularity, as well as the general influence of DJs, who are among the top 5 most influential types of people within the country, Kwaito has taken over radio, television, and magazines.\n[\n12\n]\nSouth African\nrock music\nis a very popular subculture, especially within the Johannesburg region. The\nalternative rock\nand\nmetal\nband\nSeether\ngained international popularity in the early 2000s, with five of their albums achieving\nGold or Platinum certification\nin the United States.\n[\n13\n]\nFour other rock bands,\nKONGOS\n,\nCivil Twilight\n,\nPrime Circle\n, the\nParlotones\nand have also achieved success abroad in the late 2000s. While metal bands such as\nVulvodynia\nhave achieved moderate success in the 2020s.\nScience and technology\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nScience and technology in South Africa\nSeveral important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa. The first human-to-human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon\nChristiaan Barnard\nat\nGroote Schuur Hospital\nin December 1967.\nMax Theiler\ndeveloped a vaccine against Yellow Fever,\nAllan MacLeod Cormack\npioneered x-ray\ncomputed tomography\n, and\nAaron Klug\ndeveloped crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. These advancements were all (with the exception of that of Barnard) recognised with the\nNobel Prize\n.\nSydney Brenner\nwon most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in\nmolecular biology\n.\nMark Shuttleworth\nfounded an early Internet security company,\nThawte\n, that was subsequently bought out by world-leader\nVerisign\n.\nSouth Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the\nSouthern African Large Telescope\n, the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the\nKaroo Array Telescope\nas a pathfinder for the $20\u00a0billion\nSquare Kilometre Array\nproject to be built in South Africa and Australia.\nCuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSouth African cuisine\nAn array of traditional South African cuisine\nThe\ncuisine of South Africa\nis heavily meat-based and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as a\nbraai\n. A variation of the barbecue, braais often feature\nboerewors\nor spicy sausages, and mielies (\nmaize\n) or\nMielie-meal\n, often as a porridge, or\npearl millet\n, a staple food of black South Africans. Pastries such like\nkoeksisters\nand desserts like\nmelktert\n(milk tart) are also universally popular.\nMeat on a traditional South African\nbraai\nIndian\nfood like\ncurry\nis also popular, especially in\nDurban\nwith its large Indian population. Another local Indian Durban speciality is the \"bunny\", or\nbunny chow\n, which consists of a hollowed-out loaf of white bread filled with curry.\nThe Portuguese community has also made its mark, with spicy\nperi-peri\nchicken being a favourite. The South African Portuguese-themed restaurant chain\nNando's\nnow has restaurants in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Malaysia, Kenya and the United Arab Emirates.\nWine\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSouth African wine\nSouth Africa has developed into a major wine producer, with some of the best\nvineyards\nlying in valleys around\nStellenbosch\n,\nFranschhoek\n,\nPaarl\nand\nBarrydale\n.\nSouth African wine\nhas a history dating back to 1659, and at one time\nConstantia\nwas considered one of the greatest wines in the world. Access to international markets has unleashed a burst of new energy and new investment. Production is concentrated around\nCape Town\n, with major vineyard and production centres at\nPaarl\n,\nStellenbosch\nand\nWorcester\n.\nThere are about 60\nappellations\nwithin the\nWine of Origin\n(WO) system, which was implemented in 1973 with a hierarchy of designated production regions, districts and wards. WO wines must be made 100% from\ngrapes\nfrom the designated area. \"Single vineyard\" wines must come from a defined area of less than 5 hectares. An \"Estate Wine\" can come from adjacent farms, as long as they are farmed together and\nwine\nis produced on site. A ward is an area with a distinctive soil type and/or climate, and is roughly equivalent to a European appellation.\n[\n14\n]\nEducation\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nEducation in South Africa\nSee also:\nMatriculation in South Africa\nand\nHigh school \u00a7\u00a0South Africa\nThe heart of the\nRhodes University\ncampus\nLearners have twelve years of formal schooling, from grade 1 to 12. Grade R is a pre-primary foundation year. Primary schools span the first seven years of schooling.\n[\n15\n]\nHigh School education spans a further five years. The\nSenior Certificate\nexamination takes place at the end of grade 12 and is necessary for tertiary studies at a\nSouth African university\n.\n[\n16\n]\nPublic universities in South Africa are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically oriented university degrees;\nuniversities of technology\n(formerly called \"\nTechnikons\n\"), which offer vocational oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer both types of qualification. Public institutions are usually English medium, although instruction may take place in\nAfrikaans\nas well. There are also a large number of other educational institutions in South Africa \u2013 some are local campuses of foreign universities, some conduct classes for students who write their exams at the distance-education\nUniversity of South Africa\nand some offer unaccredited or non-accredited diplomas.\nPublic expenditure on education was at 6.1% of the 2016 GDP.\n[\n17\n]\nUnder\napartheid\n, schools for blacks were subject to discrimination through inadequate funding and a separate syllabus called\nBantu Education\nwhich was only designed to give them sufficient skills to work as labourers.\n[\n18\n]\nRedressing these imbalances has been a focus of recent education policy; see\nEducation in South Africa: Restructuring\n.\nSee also:\nScouting\n[\nedit\n]\nSouth Africa has also had a large influence in the\nScouting\nmovement, with many Scouting traditions and ceremonies coming from the experiences of\nRobert Baden-Powell\n(the founder of Scouting) during his time in South Africa as a military officer in the 1890s-1900s.\nScouts South Africa\n(then known as Boy Scouts of South Africa) was one of the first youth organisations to open its doors to youth and adults of all races in South Africa. This happened on 2 July 1977 at a conference known as\nQuo Vadis\n.\n[\n19\n]\nSocietal structure\n[\nedit\n]\nGender roles\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nWomen in South Africa\nFurther information:\nFeminism in South Africa\nSexual orientation\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLGBT rights in South Africa\nSouth Africa enacted same-sex marriage laws in 2006 allowing full marriage and adoption rights to same-sex couples. Although the Constitutional and legal system in South Africa theoretically ensures equality, social acceptance is generally lacking, especially outside of urban areas. Lesbian women from smaller towns (especially the\ntownships\n) are often victims of beating or rape. This has been posited, in part, to be because of the perceived threat they pose to traditional male authority.\n[\n20\n]\nAlthough evidence of hatred may influence rulings on a case-by-case basis, South Africa has no specific\nhate crime\nlegislation; human rights organisations have criticised the South African police for failing to address the matter of bias-motivated crimes.\n[\n21\n]\nFor example, the NGO\nActionAid\nhas condemned the continued\nimpunity\nand accused governments of turning a blind eye to reported murders of lesbians in homophobic attacks in South Africa; as well as to so-called\n\"corrective\" rapes\n, including cases among pupils, in which cases the male rapists purport to raping the lesbian victim with the intent of thereby \"curing\" her of her sexual orientation.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\nSports\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSport in South Africa\nThe\nSpringboks\nin a bus parade after winning the\n2007 Rugby World Cup\nThe\nProteas\nat\nthe Oval\nin 2008\nThe most popular sports in South Africa are\nassociation football\n,\nrugby\n, and\ncricket\n.\n[\n24\n]\nOther sports with significant support are\nfield hockey\n,\nswimming\n,\nathletics\n,\ngolf\n,\nboxing\n,\ntennis\n,\nnetball\nand\nsoftball\n.

The drummers of the record\nWayo\n[\n18\n]\ncombine spiritual chanting with interlocking grooves. The mesmerizing music, centered around the\nkpaningbo\n, a large wooden\nxylophone\nplayed by three people, is completed by the rest of the village, who rotate through a series of bells and percussive instruments.\nDue to geographic location and the many years of civil war, the musical\nculture\nis heavily influenced by the countries neighboring South Sudan. Many South Sudanese fled to\nEthiopia\n,\nKenya\nand\nUganda\n, where they interacted with the nationals and learned their languages and culture. Many of those who remained in the country, while it was still part of Sudan, or went North to live in\nSudan\nor\nEgypt\n, assimilated the\nArabic culture\nand language of their neighbors.\nMany music artists from South Sudan use English, Kiswahili, Juba Arabic, their local language, or a mix of languages. During the 1970s and 1980s, Juba was home to a thriving nightlife. Top local bands included the\nSkylarks\nand Rejaf Jazz.

To achieve this, Nyerere provided what has been regarded by some commentators as one of the most successful cases of ethnic repression and identity transformation in Africa.\n[\n1\n]\nWith over 130\nethnic groups\nand\nlocal languages\nspoken, Tanzania is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in Africa. Despite this, ethnic divisions have remained rare in Tanzania, especially when compared to the rest of the continent.\nNatural history\n[\nedit\n]\nThe territory of Tanzania is home to some of the world's important archaeological excavations and their scientific interpretation:\nOlduvai Gorge\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nOlduvai Gorge\nThe\nOlduvai Gorge\nis one of the most important\npaleoanthropological\nlocalities in the world; the many sites exposed by the gorge have proven invaluable in furthering understanding of early\nhuman evolution\n. A steep-sided ravine in the\nGreat Rift Valley\nthat stretches across\nEast Africa\n, it is about 48\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) long, and is located in the eastern\nSerengeti Plains\nwithin the\nNgorongoro Conservation Area\nin the\nOlbalbal\nward located in\nNgorongoro District\nof\nArusha Region\n, about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from\nLaetoli\n, another important archaeological locality of early human occupation. The British/Kenyan paleoanthropologist-archeologist team of\nMary\nand\nLouis Leakey\nestablished excavation and research programs at Olduvai Gorge that achieved great advances in human knowledge and are world-renowned.\nIn July 2019, the Olduvai Gorge Monument was erected at the turnoff to Olduvai Gorge from the road which connects Ngorongoro Conservation Area and\nSerengeti National Park\n(a route traveled by safari-goers). Eng. Joshua Mwankunda conceived the idea of erecting a monument to commemorate this significant site while also serving as a signpost and attracting visitors to the Olduvai Gorge and museum; paleoanthropologists\nNicholas Toth\n,\nKathy Schick\n, and Jackson Njau planned and provided life-size fossil casts at the request of the Tanzanian government, which were used by the Tanzanian artist Festo Kijo to create the two large concrete skulls. The monument consists of two large-scale models of fossil skulls which sit atop a large pedestal with an informative plaque mounted on the side of the pedestal. The fossil skulls depicted are\nParanthropus boisei\nand\nHomo habilis\n, two contemporary species which were first discovered at Olduvai Gorge. The large-scale models created by Kijo are each 6 feet tall and weigh 5,000 pounds. The monument project was funded by the\nStone Age Institute\nand the\nJohn Templeton Foundation\n, in partnership with the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA).\nThe\nOlduvai Gorge Museum\n, located 5\u00a0km beyond the monument, is situated on the rim of the gorge at the junction of the main gorge and the side gorge. As one of the largest onsite museums in Africa, the museum provides educational exhibits related to the gorge and its long history.\nTendaguru excavations\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nTendaguru Formation\nThe\nTendaguru Formation\nnorthwest of\nLindi\nis considered the richest\nLate Jurassic\nstrata\nin\nAfrica\n. The formation has provided a wealth of fossils of different groups; early\nmammaliaforms\n, several\ngenera\nof\ndinosaurs\n,\ncrocodyliforms\n,\namphibians\n,\nfish\n,\ninvertebrates\nand\nflora\n. More than 250 tonnes (250 long tons; 280 short tons) of material was shipped to the\nMuseum of Natural History in Berlin\n, Germany, during excavations in the early twentieth century.\n[\n2\n]\nThe Tendaguru Beds as a fossil deposit were first discovered in 1906, when\nGerman\npharmacist, chemical analyst and mining engineer Bernhard Wilhelm Sattler, on his way to a mine south of the Mbemkure River in former\nGerman East Africa\n, was shown by his local staff enormous bones weathering out of the path near the base of Tendaguru Hill, 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi) south of Mtapaia (close to Nambiranji village, Mipingo ward, 60 kilometres (37\u00a0mi) northwest of Lindi town).\n[\n2\n]\nIn 1998, an illustrated book in Swahili, whose title translates as\nDinosaurs of Tendaguru\n, was published for young readers in East Africa. It presents a slightly different, fictitious story of the first discovery, which is attributed to a Tanzanian farmer, rather than to the German engineer Sattler.\n[\n2\n]\nRock art formations\n[\nedit\n]\nIn February 2021, Polish archaeologists from\nJagiellonian University\nannounced the discovery of ancient rock art with anthropomorphic figures in a good condition at the Amak'hee 4 rockshelter site in\nSwaga Swaga Game Reserve\nin northwest\nDodoma Region\n. Paintings made with a reddish dye also contained buffalo heads, giraffe's head and neck, domesticated cattle dated back to about several hundred years ago. Archaeologists estimated that these paintings can describe a ritual of the\nSandawe people\n, although their present religion does not contain elements of\nanthropomorphization\nof buffaloes.\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nLanguages\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLanguages of Tanzania\nA total of 130 languages are spoken in Tanzania; most of them are from the\nBantu\nfamily.\n[\n6\n]\nSwahili\nand\nEnglish\nare the two official languages of Tanzania. However, Swahili is the national language.\n[\n7\n]\nGiven the conditions of the period, it was not possible to introduce Swahili in the entire educational system, because the scale of the task of writing or translating\ntextbooks\nfor primary schools was already considerable.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAs a result,\nEnglish\n, the colonial language since the end of\nWorld War I\n, is still the language of\nhigh schools\nand\nuniversities\n. Many students leave school after finishing primary education.\nAlthough the many non-official languages in Tanzania are not actively suppressed, they do not enjoy the same\nlinguistic rights\nas Swahili and English. Some also face\nlanguage extinction\n, such as the\nKw'adza language\nthat is not spoken any longer.\n[\n6\n]\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nTanzanian literature\nTanzania's literary culture is primarily oral. Major oral literary forms include folktales, poems, riddles, proverbs, and songs.\n[\n8\n]\n:\u200apage 69\nThe greatest part of Tanzania's recorded oral literature is in Swahili, even though each of the country's languages has its own oral tradition. The country's oral literature has been declining because of the breakdown of the multigenerational social structure, making transmission of oral literature more difficult, and because increasing modernization has been accompanied by the devaluation of oral literature.\n[\n8\n]\nBooks in Tanzania are often expensive and hard to come by. Most Tanzanian literature is in Swahili or, less often, in English.

An MC performs over fast tempo taarab music, often at between 200 and 300\nbeats per minute (BPM)\nwhile females dance. Styles differ significantly between MC genders. Male MCs usually perform in fast-paced rap, while female MCs usually perform kwaya.\n[\n14\n]\nIn the few years prior to 1993, hip hop had been established in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Mwanza. It was transitioning from English performances of hip hop originating in uzunguni, rich areas like Oysterbay and Msasaki with international schools, to Kiswahili performances of kizazi kipya, originating in uswahilini\n[\n23\n]\nFollowing airtime on radio waves, bongo flava spread throughout the country, and the rest of the Great Lakes.\n[\n20\n]\nNational anthem\n[\nedit\n]\nMungu ibariki Afrika\nNational Anthem of Tanzania\nNational Anthem of Tanzania performed by United States Navy Band\n[\n24\n]\nProblems playing this file?

Such cultural objects have been collected since mainly the late 19th century by private individuals and\nethnographic\nmuseums in Europe, later followed by museums in various other countries, including the\nDar es Salaam National Museum\n. Following the appreciation of African traditional\napplied arts\nby Western artists, collectors and art exhibitions since the 1920s, such objects have been seen as\ncultural artifacts\n.\n[\n27\n]\nFrom the 1930s to 1950s, anthropologist\nHans Cory\ncollected about 1000 clay\nfigurines\nused for\ninitiation rites\nin different ethnic groups. He published these in his works, most notably in\nAfrican figurines: their ceremonial use in puberty rites in Tanganyika\n.\n[\n28\n]\n[\n29\n]\nAccording to German ethnologist Elisabeth Grohs, who studied\npuberty\nceremonies and the use of\nfigurines\nin Tanzania in the 1960s, Cory donated a large number of these figurines at the end of his life to the\nDar es Salaam National Museum\n.\n[\n30\n]\nMajor exhibitions\n[\nedit\n]\nTanzania.

With regard to the development of visual and applied arts, he discussed organizations including the National Handicraft Marketing Development Corporation (HANDICO) and its subsidiaries, the National Arts Council, the Tanzania Culture Trust Fund, the Copyright Society of Tanzania (COSOTA), the role of art galleries, foundations and associations. Further, he described modern Makonde sculpture, the so-called\nTingatinga school\nas well as fine-art paintings by Sam Ntiro and other contemporary painters.\n[\n39\n]\nTingatinga is the name applied to a popular\ngenre\nof Tanzanian paintings, which are painted with enamel paints on\nhardboard\nor canvas. Usually, the motifs are animals and flowers in colorful and repetitive design. The style was started by\nEdward Saidi Tingatinga\nin\nDar es Salaam\n. Since his death in 1972, the Tingatinga style expanded both in Tanzania and abroad.\n[\n40\n]\nContemporary Tanzanian artists include David Mzuguno, Haji Chilonga, Salum Kambi, Max Kamundi, Thobias Minzi, Robino Ntila,\nJohn Kilaka\n, Godfrey Semwaiko, Evarist Chikawe, and others.\n[\n41\n]\nCartoons\n[\nedit\n]\nTanzania's cartoons have a history that can be traced back to the work of pioneering artists, such as Christian Gregory with his\nChakubanga cartoons\nin the Uhuru newspaper back in the 1970s and 1980s, and Philip Ndunguru in the early 1980s.

    "Tunisia": "The National Foundation, Beit El-Hikma, Tunis-Carthage\nTunisian\nculture\nis a product of more than three thousand years of history and an important\nmulti-ethnic\ninflux.\nAncient Tunisia\nwas a major civilization crossing through history; different cultures, civilizations and multiple successive dynasties contributed to the culture of the country over centuries with varying degrees of influence. Among these cultures were the\nCarthaginian\n\u2013 their native civilization,\nRoman\n(\nRoman Africans\n),\nVandal\n,\nJewish\n,\nChristian\n,\nArab\n,\nIslamic\n,\nTurkish\n, and\nFrench\n, in addition to native\nAmazigh\n. This unique mixture of cultures made\nTunisia\n, with its strategic geographical location in the Mediterranean, the core of several civilizations of\nMare Nostrum\n.\nThe\nhistory of Tunisia\nreveals this rich past where different successive Mediterranean cultures had a strong presence. After the\nCarthaginian Republic\n, the\nRoman Empire\ncame and left a lasting effect on the land with various monuments and cities such the\nEl-Jem Amphitheater\nand the archaeological site of the ancient city of\nCarthage\n, which is classified as a\nWorld Heritage Site\n, one of\neight\nfound in Tunisia.\nAfter a few centuries of the presence of Christianity, represented by the\nChurch of Africa\n, the Arab\nIslamic conquest\ntransformed the whole country and founded a new city called\nAl-Qayrawan\n, a renowned center for religious and intellectual pursuits.\nReconstruction of a traditional steam bath\nWith the annexation of Tunisia by the\nOttoman Empire\n, the center of power shifted from\nTunis\nto\nIstanbul\n. This shift in power allowed the local government of the new Ottoman Province to gain more independence, which was maintained until the institution of the\nFrench Protectorate\n(which was later seen as occupation). The protectorate introduced elements of\nFrench\nculture.\nThe important elements of Tunisian culture are diverse and represent a unique, mixed heritage. This heritage can be experienced first-hand in museums such as the\nBardo\n, city architecture such as\nSidi Bou Said\nor the\nmedina of Tunis\n, cuisine such as French cheeses and croissants, music reflecting Ottoman influences, and other areas of Tunisian culture.\nCultural diversity\n[\nedit\n]\nTunisian\namulet\nThe\nEncyclop\u00e9die 360\ndescribes Tunisia as a country that \"did not develop truly original art\" but is \"strongly marked by various influences and is engrained with monuments which illustrate the various stages of its history \".\n[\n1\n]\nIn his thesis study on Cultural Policy in Tunisia, Rafik Said has mused that, \"this relatively small area has produced estates, overlapping of cultures, and a confrontation of morals and doctrines throughout its history.\n[\n2\n]\nJanice Rhodes Deledalle has referred to Tunisia as \"cosmopolitan\" and has said that \"Tunisia cannot be considered in the category of as other colonies\", because of the diversity of cultures embedded in Tunisia's heritage throughout the ages.\n[\n3\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nTunisia's cultural life dates to prehistoric times, as illustrated by\ndolmens\nnear\nBou Salem\nand\nrock carvings\nof the Tunisian\nSahara\n. The Herma\u00efon of El Guettar, discovered near the city of El Guettar in the south, is the oldest extant religious display discovered.\nThe dawning era of Tunisian cultural history was shaped by Carthaginian influences including\nPhoenician\n,\nGreek\n. There is much evidence of Phoenician and western artwork and glass work found in Punic tombs, notably in masks which the Phoenician used to drive out evil spirits or demons of death with their decorations, such as the lotus motifs found on many objects or in the artistic design buildings. The paintings and sculptures of the lids of sarcophagi from the necropolis of Carthage and El Alia, the architecture of the mausoleum of\nDougga\nare characterized by the combined influence of Greece and Egypt.\n[\n1\n]\nIn addition, we find a trace of\nHellenic\ninfluences overlapping Roman and Punic culture. In sculpture found in Tunisia, there has been a distinct, almost symbolic evolution towards a style which is a representative, idealized perfection of a body, state, etc. Greek pottery is also emulated, and it is a fact that potters from Greece were employed to produce objects in Carthage.\nPanorama of\nDougga\nThe works of Roman Tunisia do not differ greatly from those of Europe. Among those handed down to us are\nThuburbo Majus\n,\nGigthis\n, the amphitheater of\nEl Jem\n, the capital of Dougga, the Baths of Antoninus at Carthage and the Triumphal Arch of Caracalla.\n[\nwhere?\n]\nSubsequently, when Christianity was founded in Carthage, numerous monuments were erected. The Church in Africa, having been illustrated with famous martyrs such as St. Cyprian of Carthage or bishops as Saint Augustin d'Hippone, grew quickly in prestige. Many Christian monuments are erected including the catacombs of\nSousse\nor the Makthar baptistery. Basilicas in multiple aisles, like St. Cyprian, were built based on the Syrian influences.\n[\n1\n]\nHowever, the Church suffered persecution under a long reign of the Vandals who confiscated some of its properties.\n[\n1\n]\nThe arrival of the Byzantines lead to the disappearance of the latter and the restoration of a dense network of Orthodox bishops. During this period, many hills were crowned with Byzantine fortifications, such as in\nK\u00e9libia\n.\n[\n1\n]\nGreat Mosque of Kairouan\nWith the Arab conquest, specifically during the reign of the dynasty Aghlabids,\nKairouan\nbecame a renowned intellectual center, attracting many scholars. It played an important role in translation and research, particularly in the dissemination of medical science knowledge. In mathematics, contributions to computational\nalgorithms\nwere also made in Kairouan.\n[\n1\n]\nThe Arabs then erected buildings specific to Islamic architecture. While some retain a Byzantine essence, such as Three Doors Mosque in Kairouan (built in the ninth century) or ribat Sousse, many of the ancient columns are purely Arab such as the great\nZitouna Mosque\nof Tunis (ninth century), the\nGreat Mosque of Mahdia\nand the\nGreat Mosque of Kairouan\n.\n[\n1\n]\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, poets, scholars, historians increased in number in Tunisia. Zitouna Mosque, in the medina of Tunis housed the first Islamic university, and replaced Kairouan as an active center of intellectuals that included doctors and scholars, such as\nIbn Za\u00eftoun\n,\nIbn Al Abhar\n,\nIbn Al Gafsi\nand\nIbn Arafa\n. Thanks to scholars like\nIbn Khaldun\nand writers such as\nAboul-Qacem Echebbi\n, Tunisia for centuries became a major cultural center in the Arab-Muslim world and Mediterranean.\n[\n1\n]\nDuring the Turkish conquest in the sixteenth century, mosques, such as that of\nSidi Mahrez Mosque\nin Tunis were erected in a manner to those in\nConstantinople\n, although the\nZaouias\ngenerally retain their north African style in Kairouan.\n[\n1\n]\nThe French protectorate in turn left its mark on local architecture by adding a new urban style that can be found in the construction of a new city plan juxtaposed against the old medina of Tunis. Heavily influenced by Paris, with the Avenue Bourguiba, the style is known as \"\nRococo\nTunisian \".\nThe\nTunisian revolution\nbrought about important changes to the intersection of\nart and politics in post-2011 Tunisia\n.\nNation\n[\nedit\n]\nThe most spoken language is\nTunisian Arabic\n. Other languages include French and\nBerber\n.\nMediterranean Lingua Franca\nand\nSened\nare languages that are not spoken anymore. National identity is strong and Tunisian efforts to create a national culture have proved stronger than in the nineteenth century. National culture and heritage is constantly referred to with reference to the country's modern history, in particular, the fight against the French protectorate and the construction of the modern state that followed from the 1950s. This is celebrated through national holidays, in the names of streets recalling historical figures or key dates or the subject of films or documentaries. With the start of the rule of President\nZine el-Abidine Ben Ali\non November 7, 1987, the official reference to the figure 7 and the theme of \"Change\" contributes to the perpetuation of that tradition.\nFlag\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nFlag of Tunisia\nFlag of Tunisia\n(center)\nThe national\nflag of Tunisia\nis predominantly red and consists of a white circle in the middle containing a red\ncrescent\naround a\nfive-pointed star\n. The\nBey of Tunis\nAl-Husayn II ibn Mahmud\ndecided to create the flag after the\nBattle of Navarino\non October 20, 1827, which was adopted in 1831 or 1835.\n[\n4\n]\nIt remained the country's official flag during its time as a\nFrench protectorate\n, and was confirmed as the national flag of the\nRepublic of Tunisia\nwith the signing of the Constitution of Tunisia on June 1, 1959. It was not until June 30, 1999 that its proportions and design were clearly specified in law.\nThe crescent and star recalls the\nOttoman flag\nand is therefore an indication of Tunisia's history as a part of the\nOttoman Empire\n.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nIt differs from the Turkish flag, however, in the color of the crescent and the position of the star and circle. The crescent is white on the Turkish flag, but red on the Tunisian flag. On the Turkish flag, the star is off-centered, while on the Tunisian flag, the star and circle is located in the center of the flag.\nCoat of arms\n[\nedit\n]\nAs for the national coat of arms, they are officially adopted in 1861 and include revised versions on June 21, 1956 and May 30, 1963. The top has a Carthaginian galley sailing on the sea while the lower part is divided vertically and on the right depicts a black lion seizing a silver scimitar. A banner bears the national motto: \"Liberty, Order, Justice\".\nJasmine\n[\nedit\n]\nJasmine\nImported by the Andalusians in the sixteenth century,\njasmine\nhas become the national flower of Tunisia.\n[\n7\n]\nThe gathering takes place at dawn and then, upon nightfall, when young boys collect small bouquets, and later sell them to passersby on the street or to motorists stopped at intersections.\n[\n8\n]\nFurthermore, jasmine is the subject of a specific sign language. A man who wears jasmine on his left ear indicates that he is single and in addition, offering white jasmine is seen as a proof of love while on the contrary, offering odorless winter jasmine is a sign of insolence.\n[\n9\n]\nHamsa\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHamsa\nTunisian\nhamsa\nThe\nhamsa\n(\nTunisian Arabic\n:\n\u062e\u0645\u0633\u0629\n, also romanized\nkhamsa\n), is a palm-shaped\namulet\npopular in\nTunisia\nand more generally in the\nMaghreb\nand commonly used in\njewelry\nand wall hangings.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nDepicting the open right hand, an image recognized and used as a sign of protection in many times throughout history, the hamsa is believed to provide defense against the\nevil eye\n. It has been theorized that its origins lie in\nCarthage\n(modern-day Tunisia) and may have been associated with the Goddess\nTanit\n.\n[\n12\n]\nSign of Tanit\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSign of Tanit\nThe sign of Tanit is an\nanthropomorph\nsymbol\npresent on many archaeological remains of the\nAncient Carthage\nCivilization.\n[\n13\n]\nBoth the symbol and the name of the goddess\nTanit\n, are still frequently used within Tunisian culture such as with the tradition of\nOmek Tannou\n[\n14\n]\nor the grand film prize of the\nTanit d'or\n.\n[\n15\n]\nSome scholars also relate the name of the capital\nTunis\nand by extant the one of the modern country and its people to the Carthaginian goddess\nTanith\n('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nReligion in Tunisia\nMosque of Uqba\n,\nKairouan\nThe Tunisian Constitution provides freedom of thoughts and beliefs, as well as the free exercise of religion, as long as it does not affect public order. The government generally respects this right but do not allow the establishment of political parties based on religion. Muslim religious holidays such as Eid el-Adha, Eid el-Fitr or Mouled are considered national holidays. The government also recognizes the sanctity of religious holidays for non-Muslims, particularly those of the monotheistic religions.\nMinaret\nof\nZitouna Mosque\nIslam\nis the main official religion of Tunisia with a rate of around 99% of the population.\n[\n18\n]\n99% of Tunisians are\nSunni Muslims\nof the\nMaliki\nrite, the rest being attached to the Hanafi school of thought. There is also a small community of Muslim Sufis but there are no statistics regarding its size. The country is also dotted with small white mausoleums scattered in rural and urban areas and called marabouts. These tombs of saints, often male, are usually housed in places such as caves, hills, springs or points on the coast. Through meditation, these characters were supposed to heal the sick and blind. Their graves are still key to the relationship between the human and the divine in the context of festivals bringing together members of a particular community (a village, or extended family or tribe). Today, some Tunisians continue to pray and to ask them for favors.\nKhamsa\nsymbol against the\nevil eye\nIn the 1970s, an Islamist movement, based on close adherence to the\nKoran\nand other sacred texts, opposed to some unorthodox practices developed and reached its climax with the formation of a political movement, the\nEnnahda\n(\nRenaissance\n) in the 1980s. Most of their leaders were arrested or exiled during the 1990s.\nRoman Catholics\n,\nJews\n,\nGreek Orthodox\n, and\nProtestants\nare some others. These religious groups are promised their rights of practicing their religion by Tunisian government. The country is characterized by its tolerance and openness to other cultures. For instance, the teaching of Islam is compulsory in public schools but the program of religious studies at the secondary level also includes the history of Judaism and Christianity.\n[\n18\n]\nThe Tunisians also retain some native beliefs of Berber origin such as the\nevil eye\n.\n[\n19\n]\nA number of practices, such as shutters painted blue are also used to repel evil spirits.\n[\n20\n]\nLanguages\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nLanguages of Tunisia\nand\nTunisian Arabic\nTunisia is homogeneous in terms of language,\n[\n21\n]\nsince nearly all of the population masters French and Arabic (the state\nOfficial language\n) and speaks\nTunisian Arabic\nwhich is the mother-tongue of almost all Tunisians. Tunisian Arabic is actually a dialect \u2013 or more accurately a set of dialects,\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\nfor which there is no official body of standards. It is established on a\nberber\n[\n24\n]\nand\npunic\n[\n25\n]\nsubstratum\n, influenced by the languages of the people that lived or administered the region, during the course of history, including:\nArabic\n,\nTurkish\n,\nItalian\n,\nSpanish\nand\nFrench\n. Tunisian Arabic is not understood by most Arab speaking countries as it does derive from a mixture of a few languages. Tunisian is spoken mostly in the context of a daily dialogue between Tunisians and within the family. The chelha, meanwhile, is spoken by less than 1% of the population, mainly in the semi-Berber villages of the south, including\nChenini\n,\nDouiret\n,\nMatmata\n, Tamezrett, etc., and in some villages of the island of\nDjerba\n, mainly Guellala/Iquallalen, Ajim, Sedouikech / Azdyuch and Ouirsighen / At Ursighen.\nRoad signs in\nArabic\nand\nFrench\nDuring the French protectorate in Tunisia, the French introduced many institutions, especially in education. These became a strong vehicle for dissemination of the French language, which quickly became a marker of social advancement and openness to more modern and liberal values.\n[\n26\n]\nFrom independence, the country gradually became Arabized even if the administration, justice and education had long been bilingual, while the knowledge of European languages had been enhanced by exposure of Tunisia to the continent through television.\n[\n26\n]\nVisas were introduced by the French minister\nCharles Pasqua\nin 1986 for population movements between Tunisia and France.\n[\n26\n]\nBeginning in October 1999, commercial establishments were forced to give twice the space for Arabic characters as Latin characters. At the same time, the administration of Tunisia was forced to communicate only in Arabic, although only the departments of Defense and Justice and the legislature are actually fully Arabized. Like many other documents produced by the administration, the Official Journal of the Republic of Tunisia, which enacts laws and decrees, is written in\nArabic\nbut is translated in\nFrench\n, although this version has no legal value and can not be considered official. In this context, the use of French seemed to be on the decline despite the increased number of graduates of the educational system, which leads to the fact that much of French remains an important social indicator.\n[\n26\n]\nSince it is widely practiced in the business, the medical world and cultural world, we can even consider that it has gentrified.\n[\n26\n]\nKindergarten and the first three grades of school are taught entirely in\nArabic\n; thereafter, the second cycle of primary and secondary education is half Arabic and half French.\nEnglish\nwas also taught from the age of 15 from 1970, from the age of 10 from 1994, from the age of 14 from 1997, and from the age of 12 in 2000.\n[\n27\n]\nEducation\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nEducation in Tunisia\nClass of\nKhaldounia\nin 1908\nDevelopment of education\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nWomen in Tunisia\nThere was, until the nineteenth century, no modern state education in Tunisia.\n[\n28\n]\nThere was actually a score of European schools run by religious institutions\n[\n28\n]\nwhile traditional learning was taught in the Zaytuna mosque and the kouttab, particularly the religious sciences studied from commentaries on the\nQur'an\nand\nSunnah\n.\nThe first educational institution of modern Tunisia was the\nSadiki College\n, founded in 1875 by the Grand Vizier Pasha Kheireddine, followed by the Khaldounia School in 1896.\n[\n28\n]\nIn 1956, after independence, began a policy of education reform that was characterized by the unity, the nationalization and the Arabization of the education system.\n[\n29\n]\nIn this context,\nHabib Bourguiba\nsaid in 1958: \"Living on the margins of institutions and harassing the protectorate system for recognition of our rights, I told myself that if the government passed into our hands, we'd address primarily the problem of education.\"\n[\n29\n]\nThis \"problem\" was so vast that the state gave priority to national education and culture from then on.\n[\n29\n]\nThis is one reason why the Tunisian government specifically created a body dedicated to culture, then called \"Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Information\". The second reason was the need to separate culture and education, the latter no longer the only means of transmitting culture. The third reason was the responsibility to the nation.\n[\n30\n]\nIn 1966, as part of increasing political literacy of the workforce, the Institute of Adult Education became responsible for making some 150,000 people literate in a period of five years.\n[\n31\n]\nIt conducted these activities mainly in the productive sectors \u2013 agricultural cooperatives, factories, mines and large companies \u2013 but also in the craft centres, army, prisons and youth centres.\n[\n31\n]\nThe lessons of this institute include, in addition to reading, writing and arithmetic lessons, geography, history, civics, law, and social and religious education.\n[\n31\n]\nThere are also opportunities provided to take additional courses of vocational training. The length of the main course is two years with five sessions of one hour and a half per day, a total of 450 hours, culminating with a certificate of social education.\n[\n31\n]\nA third year bilingual course was created in 1968 for those wishing to continue their studies. Some 1,090 people attended this course during the 1968\u20131969 school year,\n[\n31\n]\nresulting in the institute being awarded the\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi\nPrize during the third International Day of Literacy, on September 8, 1969, \"for decisive contribution to the launch and implementation of a national adult literacy in which is developed, tested and has implemented an effective methodology for literacy and education \".\n[\n32\n]\nOn December 31, 1966, there were 21 public libraries for children and independent public libraries for adults, the former run by women.\n[\n33\n]\nMobile teachers and librarians were employed to ensure the promotion of culture in rural areas,\n[\n34\n]\nand some 52 centers of literature were established with the purpose of loaning books for home study. This measure was aimed at increasing the development of reading habits into the customs of the Tunisian people.\n[\n33\n]\nEducational system\n[\nedit\n]\nThe non-compulsory preschool education, which is for children 3 to 6 years of age, is provided in kindergartens.\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\nBasic education is compulsory and free, from 6 to 16 years, and is divided into two cycles: primary school for the first six years, followed by college for another three years.\n[\n35\n]\nThis course is sanctioned by a diploma of graduation from basic education to enable graduates to access secondary education (always free) taught in high schools for four years after the 1995 reform.\n[\n36\n]\nStudents are then directed to a second cycle of three years with five subjects (letters, science, technology, computer science and economics and management) and sanctioned by the BA for access to higher education.\n[\n36\n]\nTunisia has twelve universities \u2013 five in Tunis, one in\nSousse\n, one in\nSfax\n, one at\nKairouan\n, one in\nGab\u00e8s\n, one in\nGafsa\n, one in\nMonastir\nand one in\nJendouba\n\u2013 but it also has 178 other institutions, including 24 colleges for Technology Studies (ISET) and six higher institutes of teacher training (ISFM).\nThere are two secondary schools in Tunisia run by the French government: the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France and the Lyc\u00e9e Gustave Flaubert. These apply methods and programs similar to those in France. There is also the\nAmerican Cooperative School of Tunis\n, the\nInternational School of Carthage\n, the\nBritish International School of Tunis\nand the Tunis International School. New updates to the educational curriculum have been implemented during the last 20 years, so that it is now qualified to be an international system. 80% of Tunisians hold some kind of degree, almost 66% holding a bachelor's. The penetration rate of education among Tunisian is 87%.\n[\n37\n]\nAttendance remains strong despite high tuition fees (from 1.400 to 1.800 dinars per year in the cycle). Originally intended to educate the children of expatriates and a Francophile elite, they now attract a majority of Tunisians (over 60% of the 3,000 students today); the Tunisian bourgeoisie, in particular,  are attracted by the multicultural courses and the possibility of pursuing higher studies in France.\n[\n37\n]\nAs a result, the\nParis Dauphine University\nis considering opening an office in Tunisia in 2009 to accommodate 1,000 students.\n[\n38\n]\nVocational training is provided by a group of public operators which include the Tunisian Agency for Vocational Training, which provides instructional supervision of all public and private operators.\n[\n36\n]\nThe diplomas issued after an initial training are given at three levels: the certificate of vocational aptitude (CAP) which is a course lasting a minimum of one year after basic education, certification as professional engineer (construction) which is a course lasting a minimum of one year after the first cycle of secondary education after obtaining a CPC, and a higher technical certificate (BTP) from a course lasting a minimum of two years after the baccalaureate or after obtaining the construction certificate.\n[\n36\n]\nIn 2001, 19.9% of the Tunisian national budget was spent on education. In 2005, the literacy rate was 76.2%, and the enrollment of children 12 to 17 years was 66% among both boys and girls. Access to higher education is 27% of the age group it concerns.\nMuseums\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMuseums in Tunisia\nBardo National Museum\nStatuette of\nGanymede\nin the Carthage Paleo-Christian Museum\nThe\nBardo National Museum\nis one of the largest institutions of its kind in the Mediterranean,\n[\n39\n]\nconsisting of archaeological treasures from over several millennia by many cultures. The museum officially opened on May 7, 1888, and offers one of the finest and largest collections of\nmosaics\nof\nancient Rome\n. The\nArchaeological Museum of Sousse\n, founded in 1951, has the second largest collection of mosaics after the Bardo. The Oceanographic Museum of Salammbo, with its 11 rooms, is the main Tunisian museum dedicated to the sea. The National Museum of Islamic Art in Tunisia has several collections of pottery, pieces of Korans and\ncalligraphy\ndating from when\nRaqqada\noccupied the Aghlabids capital, from the 9th century.\nIn the 1970s, a program was implemented in cooperation with\nUNESCO\n. It provides four types of museum: museums synthesis, regional museums, local museums and specialized museums.\n[\n40\n]\nThe Bardo Museum is a good example of museum synthesis since this type of museum is expected to house objects from all periods of the history of Tunisia without taking into account the origin of these.\n[\n41\n]\nAncient Roman mosaic in the Bardo Museum\nThe existence of these museums is justified by the fact that they illustrate the evolution of artistic creation over the civilizations.\n[\n41\n]\nRegional museums are limited to chief towns and governorates, specializing in the history of each region.\n[\n41\n]\nAs for local museums, they are part of a policy of decentralization of culture to participate through museum education of the masses by encouraigng more and more people to visit the museums.\n[\n41\n]\nSome local museums exist in\nMakthar\n,\nUtica\n,\nCarthage\nand\nMonastir\n. Finally, specialized museums themselves can be divided into two other categories of museums: the museums dedicated to a historical period and museums specializing in a given subject. In the first category, there is already the\nDar Hussein\nmuseum, entirely devoted to the medieval Tunisia.\n[\n41\n]\nIn the second category, two projects were selected: the mosaic museum and a Paleo-Christian museum.\n[\n33\n]\nThe mosaic museum is fully justified by the richness of Tunisia in art museums and provides an evolution both thematically and chronologically on the subject. As for the Paleo-Christian Museum, it is now located in Carthage.\n[\n33\n]\nOther specialized museums are also considered as museums of culture and science museums. These are used to trace the history and evolution of technology.\n[\n33\n]\nArts\n[\nedit\n]\nMost of the country's older art came from the influences of\nChina\n,\nSpain\n,\nPersia\nand the Near East forming the style known as\nArabesque\n. Tunisian artists are known for their mosaics and pottery. Their mosaics use a variety of colors in repetitive patterns to adorn walls and floors by depicting a story or person. Mosaics are often used in architecture by implementing the use of geometric shapes and accenting with gold. Though, the displays of some artwork can be seen on buildings and architecture, one could find many sources of art in one place in the\nBardo Museum\nin\nTunis\n.\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic of Tunisia\nTunisian Bendir (frame drum) with snare\nTunisian music is the result of a cultural mix.\n[\n1\n]\nAccording to\nMohammed Abdel Wahab\n, Tunisian music has also been influenced by old Andalusian songs injected with Turkish, Persian and Greek influences. He believes that the Tunisian music has undergone three phases of outside influences: the first from the East and whose center was in\nMecca\nand\nMedina\n, the second coming from Muslim Spain which was the center of\nAndalusia\nand the last coming from the\nOttoman Empire\nand whose center was\nIstanbul\n.\n[\n42\n]\nThe legacy of its three phases are illustrated respectively in the creation of Tunisian traditional music, the\nMalouf\nthe introduction of the\nNuba\nin Tunisian music, and finally the use of forms such as Turkish, Samai and Bashraf.\n[\n42\n]\nAlso influenced by Western culture, it is relatively diversified.\nOf major note in Tunisian classical music is the Malouf. Deriving from the reign of the\nAghlabids\nin the 15th century, it is a particular type of Arab-Andalusian music. In urban areas it uses stringed instruments (\nfiddle\n,\noud\nand\nKanun\n) and percussion (\ndarbuka\n) while in rural areas, it may also be accompanied by instruments like the\nmezoued\n,\ngasba\nand the\nzurna\n.\n[\n43\n]\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, musical activity was dominated by the liturgical repertoire associated with different religious brotherhoods and secular repertoire which consisted of instrumental pieces and songs in different Andalusian forms and styles of origins, essentially borrowing characteristics of musical language. In 1930\nThe Rachidia\nwas founded well known thanks to artists from the Jewish community. The founding in 1934 of a musical school help revive Arab Andalusian music largely to a social and cultural revival led by the elite of the time who became aware of the risks of loss of the musical heritage and which they believed threatened the foundations of Tunisian national identity. The institution did not take long to assemble an elite group of musicians and poets and scholars. The creation of\nRadio Tunis\nin 1938 allowed musicians are greater opportunity to disseminate their works.\nAnouar Brahem\nThe 1960s and 1970s witnessed the emergence of composers and performers working mostly in the orchestra of the Tunisian Radio and Television. Song using melodies and popular rhythms experienced a significant rise. From the 1980s, the music scene saw the emergence of a generation of musicians, composers and performers of Arab and Western musical training who believed that Tunisian music needed new song writing techniques. The emergence of new patterns of racial and improvised music since the late 1990s changed the musical landscape of Tunisia. At the same time, the majority of the population is attracted by the music of Arab origin (Egyptian, Lebanese or Syrian). Popular western music has also had major success with the emergence of many groups and festivals, including\nrock music\n,\nhip hop\n,\nreggae\nand\njazz\n.\nAmong the major Tunisian contemporary artists include\nHedi Habbouba\n,\nSaber Reba\u00ef\n,\nDhafer Youssef\n,\nBelgacem Bouguenna\n,\nSonia M'barek\nand\nLatifa\n. Other notable musicians include\nSalah El Mahdi\n,\nAnouar Brahem\n,\nZied Gharsa\nand\nLotfi Bouchnak\n.\nCinema\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nCinema of Tunisia\nNaceur Ktari\n(2000)\nTunisian cinema is today recognized as one of the most liberal, inventive, and prize-winning cinemas of the Arab world. Beginning in the 1990s, Tunisia became an attractive place for filming, and numerous successful companies have emerged serving the foreign film industry.\n[\n44\n]\nCinema has been present in Tunisia since its first world appearance. Starting from 1896, the\nLumi\u00e8re brothers\nwere showing animated films in the streets of\nTunis\n. In 1919, the first feature-length movie produced on the African continent,\nLes Cinq gentlemen maudits\n(\nThe Five Accursed Gentlemen\n), was filmed in Tunisia. In 1924, Zohra directed a medium-length film called\nAin Al-Ghazal\n(\nThe Girl from Carthage\n), making him one of the first native filmmakers on the African continent.\n[\n44\n]\nIn 1966, the first feature Tunisian film,\nAl-Fajr\n(\nThe Dawn\n), was directed and produced by\nOmar Khlifi\n; it was 95 minutes long, shot on\n35 mm film\n.\n[\n45\n]\nTunisia also hosts the\nCarthage Film Festival\nwhich has been taking place since 1966. The festival, which gives priority to films from Arab and African countries, is the oldest film festival on the African continent and the Arab World.\n[\n46\n]\nIn 1927, the first Tunisian film distribution company, Tunis-Film, started its activities. After independence, movies were exclusively produced by SATPEC (\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Tunisienne de Production et d'Expansion Cin\u00e9matographique\n), which controlled cinema and filming productions in the country at the time. Nevertheless, during the 1980s, private production companies and studios emerged and wanted to make Tunisia the Mediterranean Hollywood. The producer\nTarak Ben Ammar\n, a nephew of\nWasila Bourguiba\n, succeeded in attracting some big production companies to shoot in his studios in\nMonastir\n. Major foreign movies were filmed in Tunisia, including\nRoman Polanski\n's\nPirates\nand\nFranco Zeffirelli\n's\nJesus of Nazareth\n. After visiting Tunisia,\nGeorge Lucas\nwas seduced by the natural beauty and authentic old architecture of some southern Tunisian towns, where he decided to film the important Tatooine scenes of\nStar Wars\n, as well as\nIndiana Jones\n. Moreover,\nAnthony Minghella\nfilmed the nine\nAcademy Awards\nwinner\nThe English Patient\nin a southwestern oasis of the country.\nDomestic Tunisian productions were rare. The few movies which were produced since 1967 tried to reflect the new social dynamics, development, identity research and modernity shock.\n[\n47\n]\nSome of them achieved relative success outside Tunisia, including\nLa Goulette\n(\nHalq El-Wadi\n, 1996). Directed by\nFerid Boughedir\n,\nLa Goulette\nshowed a flashback of typical community life in the eponymous small suburb, during a period when Muslims, Jews and Christians lived together in tolerance and peace. Boughedir's\nHalfaouine: Child of the Terraces\n(\nAsfour Stah\n, 1990) is possibly the biggest popular success in the history of Tunisian cinema; it showed the life of a child from the Halfouine suburb of Tunis in the 1960s, and his quest to understand relationships, the world of women and how to be a man.\nIn earlier films, including\nMan of Ashes\n(\nRih Essedd\n, 1986), director and writer Nouri Bouzid depicts controversial issues in Tunisian society, addressing social issues like prostitution, pedophilia and inter-faith relations between Tunisian Muslims and Tunisian Jews. In the 1991 film\nBezness\n, he explores the country's emerging sexual tourism trade.\nThe Ambassadors\n(As-Soufraa, 1975), directed by\nNaceur Ktari\n, portrayed the life of immigrant\nMaghrebins\nin France and their struggle against racism. The film won the Golden Tanit for the best picture in the Carthage Film Festival in 1976 and the special jury award from the\nLocarno International Film Festival\nin the same year, and was classified in the\nUn Certain Regard\ncategory during the 1978\nCannes Film Festival\n.\nThe first feature film ever to be directed by a woman in the Arab World was\nThe Silences of Palace\n(\nSamt Al-Qusur\n, 1994). The director,\nMoufida Tlatli\n, won several international jury awards for her work. The movie shows the daily life in an aristocratic palace in Tunis through the eyes of a young woman.\nIn 2007, several films were produced and grabbed public attention, such as Nouri Bouzid's\nMaking Of\nand Nejib Belkadi's\nVHS Kahloucha\n.\nTheatre\n[\nedit\n]\nMunicipal Theatre of Tunis\nThe Tunisian theater was mostly developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, during the French protectorate. Theaters grew up, such as the French Theater, Politeama Rossini, Arena, Theater Tunisia, the Gringa, Paradiso, etc. Some wooden theaters have since been destroyed by fire, while others have simply changed their function; only one is still in use as a theater, the Municipal Theater of Tunis.\n[\n48\n]\nIn over a century of existence, the theater has hosted big names of the Tunisian and international theatrical scene, such as\nSarah Bernhardt\n,\nPauline Carton\n,\nG\u00e9rard Philipe\nand\nJean Marais\n.\n[\n48\n]\nOn November 7, 1962, the Tunisian president\nHabib Bourguiba\n(whose brother, Mohamed Bourguiba, was a playwright), devoted his speech to theater,\n[\n49\n]\nwhich he considers \"a powerful means of disseminating culture and a most effective means of popular education\".\n[\n50\n]\nFrom this date, November 7 is regarded as the Tunisian National Day of drama.\n[\n51\n]\nAly Ben Ayed\n, one of the notable figures of Tunisian theatre\nIn 1970, under the leadership of the actor\nAly Ben Ayed\n,\nCaligula\nby\nAlbert Camus\nwas translated into Arabic, to great popular success. Other works written by\nHabib Boular\u00e8s\n, such as\nMurad III\nor\nThe Time of Buraq\n, retained the themes of bloody violence. Increasingly, more and more shows are restricted for the benefit of a more sophisticated audience. The New Theater of Tunis grew up with\nMohamed Driss\nas one of the most prolific authors. In 1988, Driss was appointed head of the\nTunisian National Theater\n(TNT), and took charge of renovating a neglected theatre, Le Paris, located in the heart of Tunis.\n[\n52\n]\nHe acquired a stage, employed a team of modern architects to rebuild it, and renamed it the \"Fourth Art\".\n[\n52\n]\nOpened in 1996, it alternates between cycles of TNT theater and ballet, circus and song.\n[\n52\n]\nEach cultural season lasts from October 1 to June 30; the theatre has hosted more than 80 theatrical performances.\n[\n53\n]\nIn addition to the activities in Tunis other large cities had professional theater groups, most notably Sfax, which boasted of a modern theater venue built post World War II. Many hit plays were produced by the theater group of Sfax in the 1960s and 1970s featuring one of their leading actors at the time, Habib Laroussi, who also played in many national and international TV movies and TV series. Two of the hit plays of the 1960s were \"Rabeh Zmim El Houma\" (Rabeh the neighborhood leader) directed by Jamil El Joudi and starred by Habib Laroussi, and \"Hares El Mahattah\" (The train station attendant) directed by Jamil El Joudi and starred by Mohieddin and Habib Laroussi. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Laroussi collaborated heavily with Jamil El Joudi and the prominent Sfaxien playwright Ameur Tounsi, who discovered and mentored Laroussi in the early 1950s. Tounsi wrote several hit plays that were broadcast by radio Sfax, such as \"Intikam El Zaman\" (revenge of time)starred by Laroussi and other actors from the Sfax theater community.\nEl Teatro is the first private theatre in Tunisia.\n[\n54\n]\nFounded in 1987 by Taoufik Jebali, in a wing of the hotel El Mechtel Tunis, El Teatro consists of the main hall of representatives with some 200 seats, an annex called the Carr\u00e9 d'Art, and a gallery called Free Area.\n[\n54\n]\nEl Teatro is directed by Zeineb Farhat.\n[\n54\n]\nThroughout the year, El Teatro offers theater, dance performances, jazz concerts, galas of Arabic music, art exhibitions and poetry readings.\n[\n54\n]\nDance\n[\nedit\n]\nA man teaching Tunisian dance to children.\nDancing in Tunisia is characterized by the multitude of forms it takes and contexts in which it appears, including\ncircumcisions\n, weddings, festivals, concerts, and football games.\n[\n55\n]\nTunisian dance resembles Egyptian dance, and is distinguished mainly by its dynamic, which is faster with more\nstaccato\n, and its multitude of forms, each region having its own \"style\".\n[\n55\n]\nIt is therefore difficult to speak of a Tunisian dance, especially since the Egyptian influence appears to have long proven itself in major cities.\n[\n55\n]\nThe variety of dances performed by the Tunisians probably reflects the migration flows that have traversed the country throughout the centuries. The early\nPhoenicians\nbrought with them their songs and dances, whose traces can still be seen in Tunisian dance; on the other hand, the Roman occupation had little influence on Tunisian dance, especially compared to its significant architectural legacy.\n[\n56\n]\nThe arrival of the Banu Hilal in the eleventh century completed the implementation of the Arab Maghreb in Tunisia, introducing the traditions, music and dance of the nomads of Upper Egypt.\n[\n57\n]\nReligious dances were influenced by\nSufism\n, but by the end of the 15th century they were increasingly subject to the influence of Andalusian dance and urban music. The time at which Oriental dance arrived in Tunisia is disputed: it is generally believed to have arrived at a later date with the Ottomans, but some experts in the history of North African art have said it was brought to Tunisia by the first Turkish corsairs in the sixteenth century, and others claim that it originated even earlier, founded by the early Phoenicians during the era of matriarchy in\nMesopotamia\n.\n[\n58\n]\nCharacteristic features of oriental dance as performed in Tunisia include the rhythmic movements of the\npelvis\n, movement highlighted by the elevation of the arms to horizontal, and feet moving in rhythm and transferring weight onto the right or left leg.\n[\n59\n]\nThe dance reflects a social phenomenon born in the working classes of Tunisian cities.\n[\n60\n]\nThe male dance is typically accompanied by love songs which evoke libertine seduction, attraction and the carnal pleasures of life; it has long been performed in cafes backed by music, typically the\ndarbuka\nand\nmezoued\n.\n[\n60\n]\nSince the 1970s, however, the dance has declined in cafes and is more often displayed at festivals, circumcision ceremonies, and weddings in big cities.\n[\n59\n]\nFolklore Troupe of Kerkennah\nThe Nuba, more rooted in popular practice, is linked to the dancers, and to a lesser extent the Kerkennah Djerba.\n[\n61\n]\nSome experts say that the associated dress is of Greek origin. The dance, which is structured into several scenes, is often accompanied by acrobatic games involving jars of water.\n[\n61\n]\nThe most common religious dance is probably the\nStambali\n, which originated as a ritual dance to glorify\nSidi Saad\n, a devout Sudanese Muslim who arrived in Tunisia with his followers in the sixteenth century. Today his shrine is located in the\nMornag\nregion.\n[\n62\n]\nHowever, in the aftermath of independence, the authorities have banned the ritual and closed many of the sanctuaries. While followers still continue their rituals at home, the dance has subsequently been adopted by the Jews and lost its connection to its Islamic origins.\n[\n63\n]\nThe National Troupe Folk Art Center and the National Dance of Ariana continue practice the traditional Tunisian dances.\n[\n64\n]\nThe national archives notably suffer from a lack of documents related to these dances, as well as to folk arts more broadly.\n[\n65\n]\nPainting\n[\nedit\n]\nTunisian painting\nBecause of the Muslim prohibition on reproducing the human image, the ruling dynasties of Tunisia stifled pictorial art for centuries; painters therefore often turned to calligraphy. Painting as a Tunisian art form was not reborn until the French protectorate. Although at the beginning of the twentieth century galleries were reserved for European painters, native Tunisian artists such as Moses Levy and\nYahia Turki\nwere able to obtain permission to present their work.\n[\n66\n]\nThe birth of a Tunisian contemporary style of painting is strongly linked to the School of Tunis. Established in 1949 by a group of Tunisian artists headed by\nPierre Boucherle\nand including\nYahia Turki\n,\nAbdelaziz Gorgi\n,\nMoses Levy\n,\nAmmar Farhat\nand\nJules Lellouche\n, it aimed to incorporate native themes and reject the influence of Orientalist colonial painting, bringing together French and Tunisian Muslims, Christians and Jews. Some members of the school have turned to the Arab-Muslim sources for inspiration, such as miniature Islamic architecture. The school includes both Expressionist painters such as\nAmara Debbache\n,\nJellal Ben Abdallah\nand\nAli Ben Salem\n, and abstract artists such as\nEdgar Naccache\n,\nNello Levy\nand\nHedi Turki\n.\n[\n66\n]\nPaysage des environs de Hammamet\nby\nAugust Macke\n(1914)\nAfter independence in 1956, the art movement in Tunisia was propelled by the dynamics of nation building and by artists serving the state. A Ministry of Culture was established, under the leadership of ministers such as\nHabib Boular\u00e8s\nwho saw art and education and power.\n[\n66\n]\n[\nfailed verification\n]\nArtists such as\nHatem El Mekki\nand\nZoubeir Turki\ngained international recognition and influenced a new generation of young painters.\nSadok Gmech\ndrew his inspiration from national wealth, while\nMoncef Ben Amor\nturned to fantasy.\nYoussef Rekik\nrevived the technique of painting on glass and founded\nNja Mahdaoui\ncalligraphy with its mystical dimension.\n[\n66\n]\nIn the 1970s, a new wave of artists appeared, who were less homogeneous in their academic formation. Many of them had received an artistic education almost exclusively provided by Tunisian professors at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts or at the National School of Architecture and Urbanism; such artists included\nAli Zenaidi\n, Abdelmajid Ben Messaoud, Fethi Ben Zakour, Adel Megdiche, Noureddine El Hani, Raouf Gara, Brahim Azzabi, Mohamed Njeh, and Habib Bida.\n[\n67\n]\nMany European painters have also been influenced by Tunisia; the most famous of these being the Franco-Russian\nAlexander Roubtzoff\n, often regarded as the \"painter of Tunisia\". He arrived in Tunis in 1914 through a grant from the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in\nSt. Petersburg\n, and subsequently settled permanently in Tunisia, producing some 3,000 paintings representing aspects of Tunisia before his death in 1949.\nPaul Klee\nand\nAugust Macke\nalso visited Tunisia in 1914 and left a lasting impression. Macke is noted for his series of watercolors in the\ncubist\nstyle, while Klee is noted for his advocation of light and colors to illustrate the Tunisian landscape.\nThere are currently fifty art galleries housing exhibitions of Tunisian and international artists.\n[\n68\n]\nThese include Gallery Yahia in Tunis and the Carthage Essaadi gallery.\n[\n68\n]\nLiterature\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nTunisian literature\nFirst page of a Tunisian book (1931) by\nMohamed Salah Ben Mrad\n(1881\u20131979)\nBust of\nAbou el Kacem Chebbi\nin Ras El A\u00efn (\nTozeur\n)\nTunisian literature exists in two forms: Arabic and French. Arabic literature dates back to the seventh century with the arrival of Arab civilization in the region. It is more significant in both volume and literary quality than French literature, introduced during the French protectorate from 1881.\n[\n69\n]\nTunisian literary figures include\nDouagi Ali\n, who has produced more than 150 radio stories, over 500 poems and folk songs and nearly 15 plays;\n[\n70\n]\nKhraief Bashir\n, an Arabic novelist who published many notable books in the 1930s, causing a scandal because the dialogues were written in Tunisian dialect;\n[\n70\n]\nand others such as\nMoncef Ghachem\n,\nMohamed Salah Ben Mrad\nand\nMahmoud Messaadi\n. Tunisian poetry is characterized by nonconformity and innovation, such as that seen in the works of\nAboul-Qacem Echebbi\n, while French Tunisian literature is most notable for its critical approach. Contrary to the pessimism of\nAlbert Memmi\n, who predicted that Tunisian literature was sentenced to die young,\n[\n71\n]\nmany Tunisian writers have been successful traveling abroad, including\nAbdelwahab Meddeb\n,\nBakri Tahar\n,\nMustapha Tlili\n,\nHele Beji\nand\nMellah Fawzi\n. Their writing focuses on themes of wandering, exile and heartbreak.\nThe\nnational bibliography\nlists 1249 non-school books published in 2002 in Tunisia, with 885 titles in Arabic.\n[\n72\n]\nIn 2006 this figure had increased to 1,500; in 2007, to 1,700.\n[\n73\n]\nNearly a third of these are children's books.\nPublishing\n[\nedit\n]\nDirecting Committee of the\nKhaldounia\nin 1903\nThe\nNational Library of Tunisia\nAt the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century, there was a close relationship between the bourgeois elite and business associations and the Khaldounia Alumni College Sadiki printing press.\n[\n74\n]\nThe French protectorate controlled the press, and affected the publication and dissemination of newspapers at a local level.\n[\n74\n]\nAfter the\nFirst World War\n, Tunisian gradually moved into a better position, and during the inter-war years Arabic publishing began to flourish. Before Tunisian independence was proclaimed in 1956, the publication of Tunisian literature was provided by the booksellers, printers and a few publishing houses run by the private French press; subsequently, the state commanded the creation of a major new publishing structure, with the aim of establishing a modern national culture as part of its general culture and education targets.\n[\n75\n]\nThus, the state produced over 70% of the books between 1956 and 1987, leaving private publishing little opportunity to evolve.\n[\n75\n]\nIt was not until the early 1990s that the state abandoned its role in centralising publishing. Private publishing companies quickly sprang up in reaction; the editorial production between 1987 and 1996 amounted to 6,068 titles. Most of Tunisia's present book production comes from the private sector, with over a hundred publishers in operation. The budget devoted to literature by the Ministry of Culture in 2003 exceeded three million\nTunisian dinars\nfor the purchase of Tunisian and foreign books and periodicals.\n[\n72\n]\n2003 was proclaimed \"National Book Year\" in Tunisia, and celebrated with fairs, exhibitions, meetings for reflection and debate, and writing contests.\n[\n72\n]\nMedia\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMedia of Tunisia\nHeadquarters of the journal,\nLa Presse de Tunisie\nin Tunis\nTunisian television has long been controlled by the Establishment of the Broadcasting Authority Tunisia (ERTT) and its predecessor, the Tunisian Radio and Television, founded in 1957. On November 7, 2006, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali announced the demerger of the business, which became effective on August 31, 2007. Until then, ERTT managed all public television stations (\nT\u00e9l\u00e9vision Tunisienne 1\nand\nT\u00e9l\u00e9vision Tunisienne 2\n, which had replaced the defunct RTT 2), four national radio stations (Radio Tunis, Tunisia Radio Culture, Youth and Radio RTCI), and five regional (Sfax, Monastir, Gafsa, Le Kef and Tataouine). Most programs are in Arabic, with a minority in French. Since 2003, a growth in private sector broadcasting is underway, including the creation of\nRadio Mosaique FM\n,\nJawhara FM\n,\nZaytuna FM\n,\nHannibal TV\n, and\nNessma TV\n.\nIn 2007, some 245 newspapers and magazines (compared to only 91 in 1987) are 90% owned by private groups and independents.\n[\n76\n]\nThe Tunisian political parties have the right to publish their own newspapers, but those of the opposition parties (such as Al Mawkif or Mouwatinoun) have very limited editions. Freedom of the press is guaranteed by the constitution, but almost all newspapers following the government line report uncritically on the activities of the president, government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally Party (in power) through the\nAgence Tunis Afrique Presse\n.\nFestivals\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nList of festivals in Tunisia\nHundreds of international festivals, national, regional or local punctuate the calendar year. Music and theatrical festivals dominate the national cultural scene.\nSeveral festivals take place annually in summer: the\nCarthage International Festival\nin July, the International Festival of Arts of Mahr from late July to early August, and the International Festival of Hammamet in July and August.\nThe\nCarthage Film Festival\nis held in October and November of every other year, alternating with the Carthage Theatre Festival. It was created in 1966\n[\n77\n]\nby the Tunisian Minister of Culture to showcase films from the\nMaghreb\n, Africa and the Middle East. In order to be eligible for the competition, a film must have a director of African or Middle Eastern nationality, and have been produced at least two years before entry. The grand prize is the\nTanit d'or\n, or \"Golden Tanit,\" named for the\nlunar goddess\nof ancient\nCarthage\n; the award is in the shape of her symbol, a trapezium surmounted by a horizontal line and a circle.\nThe\nInternational Festival of the Sahara\n, celebrated annually at the end of December, honors the cultural traditions associated with the Tunisian desert. This attracts many tourists and musicians from all around the world, as well as horsemen who flaunt their saddles and local fabrics and skills.\nThere are also a number of musical festivals; some honor traditional Tunisian music, while others, including the\nTabarka Jazz Festival\n, focus on other genres.\nIn the city of Sousse, the\nCarnival of Awussu\nis an annual festive and cultural event that unfolds each\n24th of July\n. It's a parade of symbolic chariots,\nfanfares\nand folk groups from Tunisia and elsewhere which takes place near the beach of Boujaafar, at the eve of the beginning of '\nAwussu\n(The word designating the\nheat wave\nof the month of August according to the\nBerber calendar\n). Originally it was a\nPagan\nfeast (\nNeptunalia\n) celebrating the god of the seas,\nNeptune\nin the\nRoman province of Africa\n, and might even go back to\nPhoenician\ntimes\u00a0: the appellation Awussu is a possible deformation of\nOceanus\n.\n[\n78\n]\nOmek Tannou\nis an ancient Tunisian\nrainmaking festival\nwhich was inherited from\nPunic\nand\nBerber\ntraditions involving invocations of the goddess\nTanit\n. It features the ritual use of the\nsculpted\nhead of a woman (somewhat resembling the head of a girl's\ndoll\n), which is carried in procession between the houses of a village during periods of\ndrought\nby children singing the refrain\n\u0623\u0645\u0643 \u0637\u0627\u0646\u0642\u0648 \u064a\u0627 \u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0637\u0644\u0628\u062a \u0631\u0628\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0634\u062a\u0627\u0621\n(transliteration:\namk \u1e6dangu ya nsa\u02be tlbt rbi \u02bfalshta'a\n, \"Amek tango, o women, ask God to rain\". This song varies according to the region because the term\nshta\ndesignates rain only in certain urban areas. Each housewife then pours a little water on the statuette, invoking rain.\nArchitecture\n[\nedit\n]\nDjerba Fort\nMain article:\nArchitecture of Tunisia\nIslamic architecture\nand\nRoman architecture\nare expressed in various facets in Tunisia. Through many buildings,\nKairouan\nforms the epicenter of an architectural movement expressing the relationship between buildings and spirituality with the ornamental decoration of religious buildings in the holy city. In\nDjerba\n, the architecture such as the fortress of\nKef\nreflects the military and spiritual destiny of a\nSufi\ninfluence in the region.\nMosque in\nKairouan\nThe influential role of the various dynasties that ruled the country, particularly in building cities and princes of Raqqada Mahdia, illuminates the role of the geopolitical context in the architectural history of the country. Thus, many original fortresses that protected the coast from Byzantine invasions evolved into cities, like\nMonastir\n,\nSousse\nor\nLamta\n.\nThe medina of Tunis, is\nWorld Heritage Site\nof UNESCO, and is a typical example of Islamic architecture. However, in the areas between the ports of\nBizerte\nand\nGhar El Melh\n, settlements founded by the\nMoors\nfleeing Andalusia were reconquered by Catholic sovereigns and has more of a Christian influence.\nMedina of\nTozeur\nGiven the cosmopolitan nature of cities in Tunisia, they have retained a diversity and juxtaposition of styles. Many buildings were designed by many different architects, artisans and entrepreneurs during the French protectorate. Among the most famous architects of that time were\nVictor Valensi\n,\nGuy Raphael\n,\nHenri Saladin\n,\nJoss Ellenon\nand\nJean-Emile Resplandy\n.\n[\n79\n]\nFive distinct architectural and decorative styles are particularly popular: those of the eclectic style (\nneo-classical\n,\nbaroque\n, etc..) Between 1881 and 1900 and then again until 1920 the style was neo-Mauresque, between 1925 and 1940 it was in the\nArt Deco\nstyle and then the modernist style between 1943 and 1947.\n[\n79\n]\nIn the south, the oasis of\nGafsa\n,\nTozeur\nand\nNefta\n, and ksours and cave dwellings of Matmata are characterized by their response to the hostile environment arising from the heat and dryness of the desert or semi-desert.\nKsar Ouled Debbab\nFort of\nGhar El Melh\nAlley of\nSidi Bou Sa\u00efd\nBuildings of the Place de la Victoire in Tunis\nTraditions\n[\nedit\n]\nCrafts\n[\nedit\n]\nPottery in Houmt Souk,\nDjerba\nTunisia is also known for its many craft products and many of the regions of Tunisia have different specialities and trades.\nTunisian pottery is mainly influenced by\nGuellala\n, a city behind the creation of other pottery centers on the coast of Tunisia, including Tunis,\nNabeul\n,\nMoknine\n, etc.\n[\n80\n]\nYellow, green or brown enamel is the trademark of Nabeul for example.\n[\n81\n]\nShaping, baking and decoration of pottery however, remain primitive.\n[\n81\n]\nThe ironwork in Tunisia dates back to the Andalusian era when the studded ornamental wrought iron doors become a characteristic. Blue is the tradition with the window shutters, intended to beautify the homes and preserve the privacy of residents and ward off evil spirits. The grids recall the lattices of the Arab-Andalusian tradition, and carved wood panels, which enabled women to watch the street without being seen.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, each region and often even each village had its own costume. Today, traditional dress is mostly reserved for only weddings and other national or native ceremonies.\n[\n82\n]\nOn a national level, the\njebba\nhas become traditional dress, a wide coat covering the whole body, which differs depending on the quality of its fabric, its colors and its trimmings.\n[\n82\n]\nThe men's slippers are usually the natural color of the\nleather\n,\n[\n83\n]\nwhile women's are generally of embroidered\nsilk\n,\ncotton\n,\ngold\nand\nsilver\nwith floral patterns.\n[\n83\n]\nAlthough the workshops in each city and some villages produce textiles typical of the region such as Gabes, the quantity sold is low compared to centers such as Kairouan which is still the national center of carpet production. The\nkilim\n, an embroidered rug is a legacy of Ottoman rule in Tunisia.\nFinally, Tunisia has a rich tradition of mosaics dating back to ancient times. Punic mosaics were found at sites around Kerkouane or Byrsa hill at Carthage dating to Roman times, a mosacis with pictorial representation, combined with high quality marble, has been found, especially on the site of\nChemtou\n.\nTraditional clothing\n[\nedit\n]\nMasculine clothing\n[\nedit\n]\nJebbas and chechias in a souk in Tunis\nIn rural areas, the jebba is considered a ceremonial garment.\n[\n84\n]\nWhite in summer and grey in winter, it is a sleeveless tunic that a man wears over a shirt, vest and baggy trousers (called seroual).\n[\n82\n]\nOn ordinary days, the men merely wear simple trousers and shirts, or/and a woollen tunic of a slimmer fit than the jebba and fitted with long sleeves. In winter, they wear a heavy wool cloak which is often hooded, or in the north a\nkachabiya\n, which differs from the latter by its brown and white stripes.\n[\n85\n]\nIn urban areas, the ceremonial dress consists of a linen shirt with collar and long sleeves. The seroual is adorned at the bottom of the legs with decorative pockets. A wide belt, cut from the same material keeps the seroual in shape. A jebba, a wool and silk full dress is worn in winter. The shoes, leather slippers, leave the heel exposed. Finally, the headdress is a chechia, a red felt hat which is sometimes adorned with a tassel of black thread.\n[\n86\n]\nFor a casual ceremony, during leisure hours, often just a jebba is worn.\n[\n84\n]\nFeminine clothing\n[\nedit\n]\nTunisian women's shoes\nWomen's clothing is much more diverse than that of men. In the towns, the vast majority of young women have adopted the European style but women of a certain age, even in urban areas, often wrap a\nsefseri\n, white veil of silk or fine wool that covers the head with a blouse and baggy pants.\n[\n82\n]\nThese figures of women wearing sefseri is engrained in the traditional culture of Tunisia as much as the blue and white houses of Sidi Bou Said. In rural areas, women still wear brightly colored dresses, often in the Berber style and made of blue or red cotton, representing their region or their village. The fabric is opened on the side and is held at the waist with a belt and at the shoulders by two clasps. Women of all ages typically wear a massive amount of jewelry with the clothing and it is common to see women with tens, even hundreds of gold sovereigns, necklaces and other trimmings around their necks and from the sides of the headdress.\nA young woman in a marriage in Djerba\nThe festive ceremonial costumes differ somewhat across regions. In the Sahel, the centerpiece of the ceremonial dress is a dress draped in wool or cotton, drawn to a bodice embroidered with silk and silver, a velvet jacket decorated with gold, lace pants and a silk belt. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the brides of the wealthy aristocracy of Tunis often wore a\nKaftan\ncut in\nvelvet\n,\nbrocade\nor\nsilk\nand richly embroidered with gold and enriched with precious stones. Nowadays, some marrying in Sousse and\nHammamet\nstill wear a kaftan with elbow-length sleeves, an open front, and varying in length from the knee to the mid calf. The richness and originality of the costumes are typically based less on the cut or the fabric as they are on woven patterns or embroidery.\nWearing the\nhijab\nis not widespread in Tunisia although the country has seen a relative increase since the early 2000s.\n[\n87\n]\nIndeed, the state prohibited it in schools and in the government offices.\n[\n18\n]\nAmong other cultural and artistic traditions of women's adornment,\njewellery of the Berber cultures\nmade of silver, beads and other applications was a common trait of\nBerber\n/Amazigh identities especially on the island of Djerba up to the mid-20th century.\n[\n88\n]\nOral traditions\n[\nedit\n]\nUntil the beginning of the twentieth century, Tunisia was characterized by the existence of a popular culture of oral narratives and puppet shows (\nmarionettes\n).\n[\n89\n]\nThe narrator, known under the terms of Rawi, or fdaoui meddah was highly respected and appreciated by both the Islamic elite and by the popular classes.\n[\n89\n]\nOften itinerant, traveling from city to city on foot, they used a\nbendir\n,\nflute\nand some\ndolls\nas an accompaniment. The performance would often include the technique of imitating various characters in the context of Halqa, when two or three other narrators are involved and invite the public to participate. Other forms of narrative are the stories told by the cyclic meddah, the character of boussadia and Stambali shows, both of which are linked to communities from sub-Saharan Africa.\n[\n89\n]\nThe narratives are institutionalized into different types: Nadira, the Hikaye, the Qissa and Khurafi. The Nadira (story), as well as recitations of the Koran was considered the oral genre par excellence by the Tunisian elite and working classes.\n[\n89\n]\nIt consists of cycles, relating a vast repertoire of stories based on vulgar but intelligent and witty character named Jha. Other narrators specialize in Hikaye or Hikayat, a Tunisian term to describe the epic sagas that recall the history of Tunisian towns and villages, particularly from the eleventh century. The latter emphasize the female characters, in which the character of Zazi represents the archetype of Tunisian women, and are a fundamental part of oral tradition as they include elements of local Arab epics.\n[\n89\n]\nAs for the Qissa, it can be defined in terms of classical Koranic stories. Didactic in nature, it is considered part of Arab-Islamic religious literature Finally, the Khurafi is the most imaginative and popular oral tradition of Tunisia. Functioning as a kind of collective memory, it results from an interaction between the narrators and the public.\n[\n89\n]\nThe puppet called\nkarakouz\n, has been present in North Africa from the fourteenth century, and the Teatro dei Pupi (originating in Sicily), enjoyed popularity until the early twentieth century.\n[\n89\n]\nThe performances took place during the month of\nRamadan\nin\nHalfaouine\n, a district of Tunis. Karakouz was once played in Turkish until the beginning of the nineteenth century before moving to the Tunisian dialect. The main characters are lively and include officials, a smoker of hashish, the French Madama, Salbi, Nina and ethnic\nAlbanians\namongst others. This type of show relies heavily on double entendres, puns,\nsatire\n,\nblack comedy\nand\ncaricature\n. Among the themes addressed are superstition, sexuality or women.\n[\n89\n]\nThe Teatro dei Pupi, executed in Tunisian dialect, account for its three main characters: Nina the Jew, Nekula the\nMaltese\nand Ismail Pasha, a valiant warrior who fought against the Christian kings.\nGender roles\n[\nedit\n]\nTunisian woman\nGradually after independence, gender roles and behavioral norms views start to change in Tunisian culture with the development of gender equality inside the society.\n[\n90\n]\nIn 1957 the Code of Personal Status (CSP) came into force, which gives women a new status, unprecedented in the Arab-Muslim world.\n[\n91\n]\nThis code establishes in particular the principle of equality between man and woman in terms of citizenship, forbade polygamy, allows women to divorce, established the minimum age for marriage at 15 for women and 18 for men and requires the consent of both spouses as a rule of validity of any marriage.\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nLater, in 1964, the minimum age for marriage was advanced to 17 years for women and 20 years for men.\n[\n94\n]\nLater, on the 50th anniversary of the CSP, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali decided to unify this age for young men and women in 2007.\nToday, the position of women in Tunisia is among the most privileged in North Africa, and can be compared to that of European women.\n[\n95\n]\nIn 2002, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women commended Tunisia for \"its great strides forward in promoting equality between men and women\".\n[\n96\n]\nNevertheless, in rural places where life to some degree remains traditional, Tunisian women still have a long way to go to reach genuine equality. The man is still considered the head of family and inheritance is completely unequal.\nThe official government policies and programs for decades has strongly emphasized on gender equality and on promoting social development, translating into concrete results. According to latest figures, women make up 26% of the working population and more than 10,000 women are heads of businesses. At the same time, over one third of the approximately 56,000 graduates emerging annually from Tunisian universities are girls. On November 1, 1983, President\nHabib Bourguiba\nappointed the first two women ministers:\nFethia Mzali\n(Family and Promotion of Women) and\nSouad Yaacoubi\n(Public Health) as leaders.\n[\n97\n]\nToday the proportions of female representation in legislative and advisory bodies are: 22.7% in the Chamber of Deputies, over 15% in the Chamber of Advisors, over 27% in municipal councils, 18% in the Economic and Social Council, 13.3% in the Higher Council of the Judiciary, 12% among ministry departmental staff. In some areas, women outnumber men, for instance in the pharmaceutical sector women represent more than 72% of all Tunisian Pharmacists. In addition, Tunisian Women are present in key national domains such Education where they constitute half of the educational body and 40% of university professors.\n[\n98\n]\nAttitudes towards minority groups\n[\nedit\n]\nThe LGBTQ+ community\n[\nedit\n]\nAlthough Tunisia is considered to be one of the  more modern and liberal countries in the Arab world, homosexuality is still considered a criminal offense. Under Article 230 of the penal code of 1913, male or female acts of homosexuality are forbidden in the Republic of Tunisia and penalized by 2-3 years of imprisonment.\n[\n99\n]\nThe Black community\n[\nedit\n]\nDespite Tunisia being an African country, racism and acts of hate crime are still prominent. It was only recently that Tunisia criminalized racial discrimination. In 2018\u00a0 Law 50 or Loi 50 was passed after the society's long term denial of the existence of racism.\n[\n100\n]\nFamily life\n[\nedit\n]\nTunisian wedding\nIn the field of marriage, partners may be selected by agreement between the family or an individual selection. Mothers often go in search of a bride for their son. Once a commitment is made it usually follows a series of visits between the two families, but disputes can lead to a rupture of the agreement. The wedding ceremony itself involves the passage of the bride to the house of her husband who waits outside. After consummation of the marriage it is followed by a period of isolation of the couple.\nThe Tunisian household is based on the patriarchal model where the man is placed in the dominant role. Most households are based upon the model of the\nnuclear family\nwithin which the tasks are assigned according to age and sex and personal skills. Developments in education and employment, however, have somewhat altered this situation.\nGastronomy\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nTunisian cuisine\nCouscous\nwith\nKerkennah\nfish\nTunisian cuisine is a blend of\nMediterranean cuisine\nand desert dweller's culinary traditions. Its distinctive spicy fieriness comes from neighbouring Mediterranean countries and the many civilizations who have ruled Tunisian land:\nPhoenician\n,\nRoman\n,\nArab\n,\nTurkish\n,\nFrench\n, and the native\nBerber people\n. Tunisian food uses a variety of ingredients and in different ways. The main dish that is served in Tunisia is\nCouscous\n, made of minuscule grains that are cooked and usually served with meat and vegetables. In cooking they also use a variety of flavors such as:\nolive oil\n,\naniseed\n,\ncoriander\n,\ncumin\n,\ncaraway\n,\ncinnamon\n,\nsaffron\n,\nmint\n,\norange\nblossom, and rose water.\nMany of the cooking styles and utensils began to take shape when the ancient tribes were nomads. Nomadic people were limited in their cooking by what locally made pots and pans they could carry with them. A\ntagine\nis the name of a conical-lidded pot, and today a dish cooked in this pot is also called a tagine.\nLike all countries in the Mediterranean basin, Tunisia offers a \"sun cuisine\", based mainly on olive oil, spices, tomatoes, seafood (a wide range of fish) and meat from rearing (lamb).\nIngredients\n[\nedit\n]\nTraditional Tunisian bread being made\nLablabi\nUnlike other North African cuisine, Tunisian food is quite spicy. A popular condiment and ingredient which is used extensively Tunisian cooking,\nharissa\nis a hot red pepper sauce made of red\nchili peppers\nand\ngarlic\n, flavoured with\ncoriander\n,\ncumin\n,\nolive oil\nand often\ntomatoes\n. There is an old wives' tale that says a husband can judge his wife's affections by the amount of hot peppers she uses when preparing his food. If the food becomes bland then a man may believe that his wife no longer loves him. However, when the food is prepared for guests the hot peppers are often toned down to suit the possibly more delicate palate of the visitor. Like harissa or chili peppers, the tomato is also an ingredient that cannot be separated from the cuisine of Tunisia.\nTuna\n,\neggs\n,\nolives\nand various varieties of\npasta\n,\ncereals\n, herbs and spices are also ingredients which are featured prominently in Tunisian cooking.\nTabil\n, pronounced \"table\", is a word in Tunisian Arabic meaning \"seasoning\" and refers to a particular Tunisian spice mix, although earlier it meant ground coriander.\nPaula Wolfert\nmakes the plausible claim that tabil is one of the spice mixes brought to Tunisia by Muslims expelled from\nAndalusia\nin 1492 after the fall of\nGranada\n. Today tabil, closely associated with the cooking of Tunisia, features garlic, cayenne pepper, caraway and coriander seeds pounded in a mortar and then dried in the sun and is often used in cooking beef or veal.\nThanks to its long coastline and numerous fishing ports, Tunisia can serve an abundant, varied and exceptionally fresh supply of fish in its restaurants. Many diners will be content to have their fish simply grilled and served filleted or sliced with lemon juice and a little olive oil. Fish can also be baked, fried in olive oil, stuffed, seasoned with\ncumin\n(kamoun). Squid, cuttlefish, and octopus are often served in hot crispy batter with slices of lemon, as a cooked salad or stuffed and served with couscous.\nSports\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSport in Tunisia\nStade 7 November\nde\nRad\u00e8s\nFootball\n(European style) is the most popular sport in Tunisia.\n[\n101\n]\nThe\nLigue Professionelle 1\nhas 14 teams that compete against one another for a trophy, also a chance to qualify for the Champions league of the\nAfrican Cup of Nations\n. The\nTunisian national football team\nwon the African Cup of Nations in the year 2004.\nHowever, sports like\nvolleyball\n(nine national team championship wins in Africa) and\nhandball\n(ten national team championship wins in Africa) are also among the sports most represented. Handball is the second most popular sport in Tunisia. In 2005, Tunisia held the\n2005 World Men's Handball Championship\nand won fourth place in the competition. Other notable sports include\nrugby union\n, martial arts (\ntaekwondo\n,\njudo\n, and\nkarate\n),\nathletics\n, and\ntennis\n.\n[\n101\n]\nOther major sports like\ncycling\nare less represented in contrast, because of lack of infrastructure and equipment but competitors still compete in the\nTour de Tunisia\n.\n[\n102\n]\nWissem Hmam\nThe Tunisian sports year is punctuated by major competitions such as the championships in football, handball, volleyball, and\nbasketball\n. The country also organizes international competitions. Thus, the first edition of the\nFIFA World Cup\nUnder-20 was held in Tunisia in 1977,\n[\n103\n]\nthe final stages of the\nAfrican Cup of Nations\nin 1965,\n[\n104\n]\n1994,\n[\n105\n]\nand 2004,\n[\n106\n]\nand the last edition was won by the national team.\nIn May 2007, the country had 1,673 registered sports clubs whose main assets are in football (250) and taekwondo (206).\n[\n101\n]\nThen come karate and its derivatives (166), wheelchair sports (140), handball (85), athletics (80), judo (66)\nkung fu\n(60),\nkickboxing\n(59), basketball (48), bowls (47),\ntable tennis\n(45), volleyball (40)\nboxing\n(37),\nswimming\n(31), and tennis (30).\n[\n101\n]\nCultural policy\n[\nedit\n]\nThe political culture of Tunisia is governed by the Ministry of Culture and Heritage Preservation, directed by\nAbderraouf El Basti\n.\n[\n107\n]\nThis department, created on December 11, 1961,\n[\n108\n]\nis, according to the decree n \u00b0 2005-1707 of June 6, 2005, \"responsible, under the general policy of the state to run national choices in the fields of culture and heritage preservation and establish plans and programs to promote these areas \".\n[\n109\n]\nIn 1999, the budget allocated to 0.6% to culture and reached 1.25% in 2009 and is set to reach 1.5% in 2010.\n[\n73\n]\n50% of this increase is linked to a policy of decentralization of culture through the promotion in the areas of cultural institutions such as houses of culture, cultural committees and associations.\n[\n73\n]\nDuring 2007, seven libraries were established and 30 public libraries managed.\n[\n110\n]\nTen houses of culture were under construction,\n[\n110\n]\nhalf completed in 2008, and another 40 houses are under maintenance. The year 2008 was also proclaimed \"national year of translation\".\n[\n111\n]\nHowever, while Kairouan's ambition is to become the \"capital of Islamic culture\" in 2009, MPs criticize some of the poor quality of artistic productions.\n[\n112\n]\nSome regret the delay in the excavation of sites such as Salakta or El Haouaria and criticize the dilapidated state of some buildings, particularly that of Borj Zouara and Bab Saadoun.\n[\n113\n]\nMoreover, the Tunisian museums should, according to some, be the subject of more attention, notably by addressing the problem of low attendance caused by the high cost of tickets.\n[\n113\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nArt and politics in post-2011 Tunisia\nList of Tunisian artists\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nEncyclop\u00e9die 360\n, \u00e9d.

In this ceremony, both the child and mother spend 3 days in a grass thatched house. Traditionally, they are tasked to drink sweetened\nmillet\nporridge. As the 3 days elapse, both the mother and child sit at the door entrance with a company of paternal brothers.\n[\n9\n]\nThis is believed to restore the lost manhood after the healing ritual is performed. The\nAcholi people\nand\nLango people\nhave their unique dances, such as\nLarakaraka\nand\nBwola\nfor Acholi, and Okeme/Abuda for Lango people.\n[\n9\n]\n[\n10\n]\nIn Western Uganda, there is the\nEmpaako\nnaming system where the indigenous communities of\nBatooro\n, Banyoro, Batuku, Banyabindi, and Batagwenda identify traditional names that match different seasons, times, and clans, among others.

From its precolonial prosperity and complexity to the trials of colonialism and the eventual tumult of independence and beyond, Zimbabwe's history is a profound story of resilience, endurance, and transformation. In this article, we shall traverse the historical landscape of Zimbabwe, exploring its storied past and the indelible imprint it has left on the present.\nThe roots of Zimbabwean civilisation stretch far back in time, weaving a tapestry of cultural and political innovation. The tale begins with the Bantu-speaking farmers, who, during the Iron Age, traversed the Limpopo River, infusing the region with new agricultural techniques and ironworking skills (Beach, 1994). These migrants forged the foundation of early Zimbabwe, a cultural legacy evidenced today by the imposing stone walls of Great Zimbabwe, an architectural marvel that stood as the nerve centre of an influential precolonial state, flourishing between the 11th and 15th centuries (Fontein, 2006).\nGreat Zimbabwe, which gave the modern nation its name, was a political and economic powerhouse, its influence rippling throughout Southern Africa. The city was part of an extensive trading network, exchanging gold, ivory, copper, and iron for luxury goods from as far afield as China and the Persian Gulf, a testament to the globalised world of medieval commerce (Chirikure, 2018). Its ruins, which remain amongst the largest stone structures in Southern Africa, embody the zenith of precolonial Zimbabwean cultural and architectural sophistication.\nSource: Beach, D. N. (1994).

Metals in Past Societies: A Global Perspective on Indigenous African Metallurgy. Springer International Publishing.\nThe arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century marked the beginning of foreign intervention in Zimbabwe. Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries penetrated the hinterland, seeking gold and converts, respectively, but it was not until the late 19th century that European incursions had a seismic impact on the region. The advent of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa Company heralded a new era, as his charter with Queen Victoria granted the company comprehensive administrative and economic control over the region - a stark departure from the sovereignty known by the likes of Great Zimbabwe (Palmer, 1977).\nRhodes' legacy is fraught with controversy, emblematic of the era's imperialism and the grievous repercussions for indigenous populations. Land was appropriated, local governance structures undermined, and the native Shona and Ndebele peoples consigned to an existence of subjugation and exploitation (Ndlovu-Gatsheni, 2009). The forced labour and taxation policies imposed by the British South Africa Company fomented discontent, culminating in the Chimurenga, or First War of Liberation, a vehement but ultimately vanquished resistance against colonial rule (Ranger, 1985).\nSource: Palmer, R.

Gweru: Mambo Press.\nFast forward to the 20th century, and Zimbabwe's quest for independence intensified. The 1960s and 70s were decades of convulsion, as African nationalist movements challeneged colonial rule throughout the continent. In Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was then known, two main liberation movements, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), orchestrated a protracted guerrilla warfare against the minority white government led by Ian Smith, who had unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965 in a bid to prevent black majority rule (Meredith, 2002).\nThe Liberation War, or Second Chimurenga, was bitter and prolonged, with neighbouring countries providing sanctuary and support for Zimbabwean nationalists. The conflict wore on until the Lancaster House Agreement was signed in 1979, a negotiated settlement that finally paved the way for free elections and the establishment of an independent Zimbabwe in 1980, with ZANU leader Robert Mugabe assuming the mantle of Prime Minister (Sibanda, 2005).\nSource: Meredith, M.

The Zimbabwe African People's Union 1961-87: A Political History of Insurgency in Southern Rhodesia. Africa World Press.\nThe independent era of Zimbabwe has been one of both hope and hardship. Initially, Mugabe implemented policies of reconciliation, infrastructure development, and education, culminating in significant advancements and a burgeoning economy. However, in the subsequent years, political repression grew, economic mismanagement took its toll, and the controversial land reform program at the turn of the millennium led to international sanctions, hyperinflation, and a dramatic decline in living standards (Raftopoulos & Mlambo, 2009). Despite these challenges, Zimbabweans have demonstrated remarkable fortitude, contributing to the arts, sport, and academia with steadfast vigour.\nSource: Raftopoulos, B., & Mlambo, A. (2009). Becoming Zimbabwe. A History from the Pre-colonial Period to 2008. Harare: Weaver Press.\nIn conclusion, the history of Zimbabwe is one of great achievements and equally profound challenges. Its early societies set the stage for a state that would withstand the test of time. The colonial experience, while devastating, did not obliterate the enduring spirit of the Zimbabwean people. Independence, hard-fought and dearly won, has meant navigating the complexities of self-governance, grappling with legacies of inequality, and contending with the pressures of global politics. As Zimbabwe continues to evolve, its history remains a mirror through which its future is both reflected and shaped.\nLanguage\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nneeds expansion\n. You can help by\nadding to it\n.\n(\nFebruary 2012\n)\nSee also:\nLanguages of Zimbabwe\nZimbabwe has 16 official languages,\n[\n1\n]\nChewa\n,\nChibarwe\n,\nEnglish\n,\nKalanga\n, \"Koisan\" (presumably\nTsoa\n),\nNambya\n,\nNdau\n,\nNdebele\n,\nShangani\n,\nShona\n, \"sign language\" (\nZimbabwean sign languages\n),\nSotho\n,\nTonga\n,\nTswana\n,\nVenda\n, and\nXhosa\n. Much of the population speaks\nBantu languages\n, such as\nShona\n(chishona) (76%) and\nNdebele\n(18%). Shona has a rich oral tradition, which was incorporated into the first Shona novel,\nFeso\nby\nSolomon Mutswairo\n, published in 1957. English is spoken primarily in the cities, but less so in rural areas.\nEducation in Zimbabwe\nis taught in English, Shona and Ndebele. Many rural primary schools teach in the native language until grade three; then, school is taught in English.\n[\n2\n]\nFood\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nZimbabwean cuisine\nLike in many African countries, a majority of Zimbabweans depend on staple foods. \"Mealie meal\", or\ncornmeal\nas it is known in other parts of the world, is used to prepare\nbota\n, a porridge made by mixing cornmeal with water, to make a thick paste. This is usually flavored with\nbutter\nor\npeanut butter\n. Bota is usually eaten for breakfast. Cornmeal is also used to make\nsadza\n, which is usually eaten for dinner, and by many for lunch too. The process of making sadza is similar to bota, however after the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste until it is firm. This meal is usually served with\nvegetables\n(\nspinach\n,\nchou moellier\n, or\nspring greens\n/\ncollard greens\n),\nbeans\n, and\nmeat\n(stewed, grilled, roasted, or sundried). Sadza is also commonly eaten with\nboerewors\n(a sausage made from\nbeef\nor\npork\n),\nchicken\n, or curdled milk (\nsour milk\n), commonly known as \"lacto\" (\nmukaka wakakora or \"amasi\"\n).\nRice\nand\nchicken\nwith coleslaw salad is often served as the main meal. Graduations, weddings, and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a\ngoat\n,\nsheep\n, or\ncow\n, which will be\nbraaied\n(or barbecued) for the gathered family.\nSince Zimbabwe was a British colony, they have adopted some English habits. For example, most people will have\nporridge\nin the morning, however they will still have 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, which can be leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked\nsadza\n, or\nsandwiches\n(which is more common in the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for\ntea\nto be had after dinner.\nArt\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nZimbabwean art\nTraditional arts in Zimbabwe include\npottery\n,\nbasketry\n,\ntextiles\n,\njewelry\nand\ncarving\n. Among the distinctive qualities are symmetrically patterned woven baskets and stools carved out of a single piece of\nwood\n. Shona sculpture in modern times has become a fusion of African folklore with European influences. It is widely respected across the globe and it itself has had an impact on the global sculpture scene since at least the 1980s. A recurring theme in Zimbabwean art is the metamorphosis of man into beast. Cartwark, M. is of the view that,\nA number of finely carved soapstone figures have been found which include eight representations of birds perched on monoliths over one metre (39 inches) in height. The bird is known as the Zimbabwe Bird and does not resemble any bird in nature; it appears on the flag of the country today. Such artefacts as the soapstone figures hint at the ritual nature of the Great Zimbabwe site. Other sculptures include cattle and nude highly-stylised female figures. Simple unglazed pottery of very good quality was produced - very often given a graphite covering and then polished. Forms include gourd-shaped vessels with distinctive hatched triangular decorations, small disks of uncertain purpose, and models of huts.\nAmong members of the white minority community,\ntheatre\nhas a large following, with numerous theatrical companies performing in Zimbabwe's urban areas.\nThe country's art is admired by those that know of its existence, and several Zimbabwean artists have managed to gain a world audience. To name some world-famous Zimbabwean sculptors, we have Nicholas, Nesbert and\nAnderson Mukomberanwa\n,\nTapfuma Gutsa\n,\nHenry Munyaradzi\n, and\nLocardia Ndandarika\n. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence a new generation of artists, particularly\nAfrican Americans\n, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists, including New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the\nUnited States\n.\nZimbabwe's cultural wall is the durawall.\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nArchitecture of Zimbabwe\nBalancing rocks of Zimbabwe\nEducation in Zimbabwe\nReps Theatre\nand\nOver the Edge\n(Zimbabwe Theatrical Companies)\nMusic of Zimbabwe\nRhodesiana\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nNemukuyu, Daniel.\n\"Constitution now available in 16 languages\"\n.\nThe Herald\n.
